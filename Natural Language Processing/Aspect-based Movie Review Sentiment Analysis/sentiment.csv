0,KS_Doc1_2001 Space Odyssey.txt,"In the spring of 1964 the filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was very worried. NASA was about to fly the Mariner 4 space probe past Mars.
That was 54 years ago. We still havent discovered intelligence or even believable evidence of pond scum anywhere else in the universe  not for lack of effort. A new spacecraft,TESS, designed to look for habitable nearby planetsjust vaulted into space, and aninterstellar asteroidrecently spotted streaking through the solar system was inspected for radio signals. Another robot is on its way tolisten in on the heart of Mars. We still dont know if we are alone.
The story begins four million years ago in Africa, where a bunch of bedraggled primates are losing the battle of the survival of the fittest until a strange black monolith appears. To the thunder of Also Sprach Zarathustra, one of those apemen is inspired to pick up a bone and use it as a club to kill the animals that have been pushing him around.
Around that toss Kubrick pivots his movie and all of human evolution. Another monolith appears on the moon, and yet another in orbit around Jupiter, where an astronaut named Dave Bowman connects with it after subduing a neurotic computer, the HAL 9000, which has murdered his shipmates. In the finale, Bowman is sent through a star gate on a trip through space and time, death and rebirth, returning as a glowing Star Child to float like a fetus over the Earth.
2001 comes back at another poignant time in history, especially as it relates to space and the cosmos. Once we got to the moon,the script of future historywas abandoned by the Nixon White House.
But now the traditional sci-fi script has flipped. A generation of swashbuckling billionaires has taken center stage in the space business, as well as a new class of wealthy customers who can afford to indulge their services
Where the script has really flipped is in the future history of evolution.
Robots have taken over the sacred task of exploring for us. Increasingly sophisticated and smaller machines have spread out to every world of the solar system,buzzing the rings of Saturn, daring thedark voids beyond Plutoandlanding on comets, scanning the heavens for new planets, new places to dream about. There have been enough robots, landers and orbiters violating the skies and surface of Mars to spark legends and myths and paranoia among whatever life-forms might be there.
Worse, we may all be part of the dream. The news from some physicists likethe late Stephen Hawkingis thatthe universe might be a hologram, an illusion like the three-dimensional images on a bank card. Some cosmologists have argued that it is not inconsistent  at least mathematically  to imagine thatthe entire universe as we know it could just be a computer simulation,as in The Matrix  another movie with long shadows. In effect, we are all made of bits, so the argument goes, removable, deformable at the click of an interstellar mouse.

1,KS_Doc2_Wargames.txt,"I am writing this review on a word processor that is connected to a computer that sets the type for the Sun-Times. If I make an error, the computer will tell me. Observe. I instruct it to set this review at a width of 90 characters. It flashes back: Margin too wide. Now things get interesting. I ask it to set the width at 100 characters
Computers only do what they are programmed to do, and they will follow their programs to illogical conclusions. Example. This time I tell the computer to set my review at a width of 10 characters. It does! Having read 100 as 10 and found 10 too narrow, it reads 10 as 10, and lets me have my way. I've outsmarted the S.O.B.
Sooner or later, one of these self-satisfied, sublimely confident thinking machines is going to blow us all off the face of the planet. That is the message of ""WarGames,"" a scary and intelligent new thriller that is one of the best films so far this year. The movie starsMatthew Broderick(the kid from ""Max Dugan Returns"") as a bright high school senior who spends a lot of time locked in his bedroom with his home computer. He speaks computerese well enough to dial by telephone into the computer at his school and change grades. But he's ready for bigger game.
He reads about a toy company that's introducing a new computer game. He programs his computer for a random search of telephone numbers in the company's area code, looking for a number that answers with a computer tone. Eventually, he connects with a computer. Unfortunately, the computer he connects with does not belong to a toy company. It belongs to the Defense Department, and its mission is to coordinate early warning systems and nuclear deterrents in the case of World War III. The kid challenges the computer to play a game called ""Global Thermonuclear Warfare,"" and it cheerfully agrees.
As a premise for a thriller, this is a masterstroke. The movie, however, could easily go wrong by bogging us down in impenetrable computerese, or by ignoring the technical details altogether and giving us a ""Fail Safe"" retread. ""WarGames"" makes neither mistake. It convinces us that it knows computers, and it makes its knowledge into an amazingly entertaining thriller. (Note I do not claim the movie is accurate about computers -- only convincing.)
I've described only the opening gambits of the plot, and I will reveal no more. It's too much fun watching the story unwind. Another one of the pleasures of the movie is the way it takes cardboard characters and fleshes them out. Two in particular: the civilian chief of the US computer operation, played byDabney Colemanas a man who has his own little weakness for simple logic, and the Air Force general in charge of the war room, played byBarry Corbinas a military man who argues that men, not computers, should make the final nuclear decisions.

2,KS_Doc3_The_Matrix.txt,"""The Matrix,"" with Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss. Written and directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski. 
Extremely violent, extremely preposterous, extremely entertaining, ""The Matrix"" succeeds at two extremely difficult tasks: as a vast, exciting virtual-reality movie and as a defibrillator for Keanu Reeves' big screen career.
Using the pantheon of movie iconography from the past 100 years - from ""High Noon"" showdowns, to bad kung fu, to love's first kiss - the writing/directing team of the Wachowski brothers, Larry and Andy, achieves a fantastic, hodgepodge symmetry using hacker noir, comedy and mindless action.
Thomas Anderson (Reeves) is a talented computer programmer at a monolithic corporation during the day, but at night he's an unscrupulous hacker tagged Neo. His work brings him to the attention of Morpheus (Fishburne), a mysterious stranger who tantalizes Neo.
Morpheus compares him to Lewis Carroll's Alice, with talk of other worlds and realities. He offers Neo two pills: a blue one, which will allow things to continue on as they have, and a red one, which purportedly will lift the veil from his eyes and allow him to see ""how deep the rabbit hole goes."" This being a movie, and since the plot would pretty much stop here if he didn't, Neo takes the red one.
When the veil does lift, it's Kafka meets ""Die Hard,"" and Neo realizes the awful truth that Morpheus has wanted him to see. It's a truth darker than ""Dark City,"" more memorable than ""Johnny Mnemonic"" and as terminal as ""The Terminator."" It's bad for him, but it's good for us.
The most critical aspect of this film's success is the creation of the Matrix world, a simulacrum of reality where most of the people in this film work, fight and die. The Wachowskis set up certain rules for this reality and try to stick to them - thus making the realm as important as the ""real"" world.
Reeves, who in the past has been accused of being kind of a virtual-reality effect himself, acquits himself nicely as Neo. The long, lingering stench of ""Johnny Mnemonic"" dissipates in the first few moments of the film.
Actually, it isn't dissipated, it's blown away with the exhilarating opening fight sequence. It's a desperate chase between Trinity (a Sigourney Weaver career jump-starter role for Carrie-Anne Moss) and the Matrix agents. 
It's evident that the Wachowski brothers (whose last effort was the erotic cranker ""Bound"") brought something extra to the table. Someone else's treatment of their script could have turned into a ponderous, gorgeous, somber affair, like ""Dark City.""
Most hacker noir films seem to vie for the ""Blade Runner"" production design award, entirely forgetting their audience and their story. Not the Wachowskis. They're like little kids playing with blocks, building and constructing. Then they use the wow-filled, ""Flo-mo"" and ""bullet time"" special effects of Jon Gaeta and the designs of Owen Paterson to knock those blocks down.
And knock they do, demolishing the wall between the standard ""question reality"" movie and an action film. When the dust settles, ""The Matrix"" is all that's left standing.

3,KS_Doc4_I_Robot.txt,"'I, Robot"" takes place in Chicago circa 2035, a city where spectacular new skyscrapers share the skyline with landmarks like the Sears (but not the Trump) Tower. The tallest of the buildings belongs to U.S. Robotics, and on the floor of its atrium lobby lies the dead body of its chief robot designer, apparently a suicide.
Det. Del Spooner is on the case.Will Smithplays Spooner, a Chicago Police Department detective who doesn't think it's suicide. He has a deep-seated mistrust of robots, despite the famous Three Laws of Robotics, which declare above all that a robot must not harm a human being.
The dead man is Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), who, we are told, wrote the Three Laws. Every schoolchild knows the laws were set down by the good doctor Isaac Asimov, after a conversation he had on Dec. 23, 1940, withJohn W. Campbell, the legendary editor of Astounding Science Fiction. It is peculiar that no one in the film knows that, especially since the film is ""based on the book by Isaac Asimov."" Would it have killed the filmmakers to credit Asimov?
The movie makes Spooner into another one of those movie cops who insults the powerful, races recklessly around town, gets his badge pulled by his captain, solves the crime and survives incredible physical adventures. In many of these exploits he is accompanied by Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), whose job at U.S. Robotics is ""to make the robots seem more human.""
At this she is not very successful. The movie's robots are curiously uninvolving as individuals, and when seen by the hundreds or thousands look like shiny chromium ants. True, a robot need not have much of a personality, but there is one robot, named Sonny and voiced byAlan Tudyk, who is more advanced than the standard robot, more ""human,"" and capable of questions like ""What am I?"" -- a question many movie characters might profitably ask themselves.
If Sonny doesn't have real feelings, he comes as close to them as any of the humans in the movie. Both Spooner and Calvin are kept in motion so relentlessly that their human sides get overlooked, except for a touching story Spooner tells about how a little girl dies because a robot was too logical. Sonny doesn't seem as ""human"" as, say, Andrew, the robot played byRobin Williamsin ""Bicentennial Man"" (1999), based on a robot story by Asimov andRobert Silverberg. But his voice has a certain poignancy, and suggests some the chilly chumminess of HAL 9000.
The plot I will not detail, except to note that you already know from the ads that the robots are up to no good, and Spooner could write a lot of tickets for Three Laws violations.
As for the robots, they function like the giant insects in ""Starship Troopers,"" as video game targets. You can't even be mad at them, since they're only programs. Although, come to think of it, youcanbe mad at programs; Microsoft Word has inspired me to rage far beyond anything these robots engender.

4,KS_Doc5_Ex_Machina.txt,"After a recent run ofoverly-hyped, butultimatelydisappointingsci-fi efforts, fans of the genre finally have something worth getting excited about. Non genre filmgoers should probably get excited too. For the first time in a long time, we have an artificial intelligence film with, well, intelligence.
Ex Machina, novelist and screenwriterAlex Garlandsdirectorial debut, treads on the well-worn sci-fi territory of technophobia, god complexes, and lethal robots, but it does so with an intelligence and sophistication that never underestimates either the viewer or the capacity of the genre.
The film kicks off when a nice young coder named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a mysterious trip to spend a week at the opulent home (more of a compound, really) of Nathan (Oscar Isaac), his boss and CEO of fictional internet giant Blue Book. During his visit, Caleb meets two women: Nathans assistant and lover Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) and his invention, a robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander). Ava the robot is a CGI confection made of human face, hands, and feet held together by sinewy mesh, translucent limbs, and a see-through torso filled with blinking lights, and whirring gears.
Nathan tasks Caleb with engaging Ava in the Turing test (yes,named forthatTuring) in order to determine whether his artificially intelligent creation can think and act like a human. As you might expect in a film about a vulnerable young man, an alluring robot girl, and a billionaire with a god complex locked up in a high-tec bunker, things start to go horribly wrong.
Nathans claustrophobic underground lair takes on the feel of that classic sci-fi setting: the spaceship. But wide exterior shots (filmed on location in Norway) of lush forests and one particularly stunning glacier play the role of outer space, putting mans small, technological accomplishments in the context of natures vast splendor.
That blurred relationship between the organic and inorganic used to best effect in Avas elegant flesh and mesh design  crops up throughoutEx Machinato underline the notion of artificial intelligence as the next, inevitable phase in our evolution. Vikanders face moves robotically, yes, but also takes on a curious bird-like quality  bright eyes blinking and inquisitive head tilting.
Ex Machinacertainly isnt theonlysuccessful artificial intelligence film out there, and Vikanders crackling honey voice and seductive demeanor make the comparison toScarlett JohanssoninHerpretty inevitable. But whileSpike Jonzesfilm was all heart,Ex Machinais just brimming with brains. For every obvious cultural reference to scientific disaster (you bet Robert Oppenheimer gets quoted), theres a subtle one, like snippets of Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Darks 1980s anthem Enola Gay.

5,KS_Doc6_Her.txt,"Spike Jonze's ""Her"" plays like a kind of miracle the first time around. Watching its opening shots ofJoaquin Phoenixmaking an unabashed declaration of eternal love to an unseen soul mate is immediately disarming. 
As the movie continues, and the viewer learns more of what an ordinary guy Theodore ishe checks his e-mail on the ride home from work, just like pretty much all of us these daysdirector Jonze, who also wrote the movie's script, constructs a beguiling cinematic world that also starts to embrace the viewer. The way Theodore's smart phone and its earpiece work is different from ours, and soon it becomes clear that ""Her"" is something of a science-fiction film, set in the not-too-distant but distinctly fantastic future. 
The futuristic premise sets the stage for an unusual love story: one in which Theo, still highly damaged and sensitive over the breakup of his marriage (""I miss you,"" a friend tells him in a voice mail message; ""Not the sad, mopey you. The old, fun you""), falls in love with the artificially intelligent operating system of his computer. The movie shows this product advertised and, presumably, bought in remarkable quantity, but focuses on Theo's interaction with his OS, which he gives a female voice. The female voice gives herself the name ""Samantha"" and soon Samantha is reorganizing Theo's files, making him laugh, and developing something like a human consciousness.
It's in Theo and Samantha's initial interaction that ""Her"" finds its most interesting, and troubling depths. Samantha, being, you know, a computer, has the ability to process data, and a hell of a lot of it, at a higher speed than human Theo. ""I can understand how the limited perspective can look to the non-artificial mind,"" she playfully observes to Theo. And while Samantha's programming is designed to make her likable to Theo, her assimilation of humanity's tics soon have the operating system feeling emotion, or the simulation of it, and while the viewer is being beguiled by the peculiarities and particularities of Theo and Samantha's growing entanglement, he or she is also living through a crash course on the question of what it means to be human.
At first Theo feels a little odd about his new ""girlfriend,"" and then finds out that his pal Amy (Amy Adams) is getting caught up in a relationship with the OS left behind by her estranged husband. Jonze drops funny hints about what the existence of artificial intelligence in human society might affect that society. He also gets off some pretty good jokes concerning video games.
But he also creates moments of genuinely upsetting heartbreak, as in Theo's inability to understand what went wrong with his marriage to Catherine (Rooney Mara, quite wonderful in what could have been a problematic role) and their continuing inadvertent emotional laceration of each other at their sole ""present"" meeting in the movie.
""Her"" remains one of the most engaging and genuinely provocative movies you're likely to see this year, and definitely a challenging but not inapt date movie.

6,KS_Doc7_The Terminator.txt,"On Oct. 26, 1984, a newsci-fifranchise was launched with the U.S. theatrical debut of The Terminator. That same day, The Hollywood Reporter saw the merits in the film, and even hoped for a sequel. Read the original review below:
No doubt about it: Arnold Schwarzenegger was born to playThe Terminator. In this nail-biting Orionsci-fiadventure fromHemdale, the beefyConanstar, cast in his first villainous role, dishes out destruction with a fiendish relish certain to neutralize box-office competition. The havoc makes for a genuine steel metal trap of a movie that may very well be the best picture of its kind sinceThe Road Warrior.
Schwarzenegger plays an emotionless cyborg sent from the future to assassinate a young woman (Linda Hamilton) whose unborn child is destined to become apostapocalypticsaviour. Tracking him is MichaelBiehn, assigned to protect the girl and terminate the Terminator. On the outcome of their struggle  as eerieflashforwardsto the skull-lined streets of21stcentury Los Angeles remind us rests the future of the world.
A remarkably spare script by James Cameron and Gale AnneHurdgives new dimension to this age-old morality play, working in plenty of pointed comment on our presentovermechanizationinto its action-film context. Images do most of the talking, and Cameron, in his first major directorial effort, proves a lean, economical storyteller, setting up his shorts for maximum visceral impact.
Cameron is ably abetted by Adam Greenberg's crisp, incisive camerawork; MarkGoldblatt'sfine-tooled editing, which discreetly cuts away from most of the bloodshed, and Brad Fidel'spulsatinglypersuasive score. The futuristic landscapes are impressively sketched by the Fantasy II visual effects group and Stan Winston provides stop-motion magic that recalls the best of RayHarryhausen.
The most imposing special effect, however, is Schwarzenegger himself. Outfitted from head to toe in basic black and armed to the teeth with state-of-the-art weaponry, the ex-strong man comes on like evil incarnate, and his bullet-pumping presence lends the film a very tangible sense of menace. His single-handed destruction of an intercity police station is certain to rank high in the annals of on-screen dastardly deeds.
Schwarzenegger has a worthy adversary in MichaelBiehn, whose grimly determined features expressively convey most of the film's thematic weight. Linda Hamilton displays tremendous resiliency as the unsuspecting target, and there is some engaging support from Paul Winfield and LanceHenriksenas harried detectives. But it's Arnold's movie all the way.
There's something downright satisfying about seeing this big, lovable lug play a remorseless heavy, and one hopes the mean streak has not run its course.Terminator II, where are you?Kirk Ellis

Publication Source/Venue: Vanity Fair, Sept. 3. 2020.
URL: https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/09/review-disneys-new-mulan-is-a-dull-reflection-of-the-original
Top 5 Words: Mulan, Disney, action, remake, lifeless 
Summary: This article summarizes the recent Disney remake movie, Mulan. The author calls the movie a ‘lifeless’ remake that is missing the magic and creativity that was in the original Disney movie. 



Long ago, in the ancient year of 1998, Disney tried something tricky: an animated princess musical that was also an action movie, with big fight scenes no doubt aimed at appealing to little boys who may have balked at another Beauty and the Beast or Little Mermaid. (For such balking was encouraged in boys more back then than it is now, though it is still plenty encouraged.) In making Mulan—based on the Chinese legend of warrior woman Hua Mulan, who fights for the emperor’s army in her father’s stead, disguised as a man—also continued a half-hearted project of diversity, adding more global shape to its princess canon. It was, at the time, a big deal.

The film, directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft, earned that bigness in enough places. There was the powerhouse ballad “Reflection,” sung by Lea Salonga in the film but rerecorded by Christina Aguilera, the belter’s first single and still one of her most enduring songs. And there was an eye-popping mountain battle scene, aided by ever more confident computer animation, in which an invading horde of Huns is subsumed by an avalanche. It’s stunning stuff, still now, even though much of the rest of the hand-drawn animation looks so sadly quaint from the vantage point of the digital age.

Without the songs and silliness of the 1998 original, 2020’s Mulan throws itself into comparison not with other children’s classics, but with hundreds of other sword-and-sandal films that have all pretty much done what Mulan does before. Caro, filming in New Zealand and China, finds some stunning backdrops. The costumes look great. The martial arts sequences nicely approximate the fluid, floating grace of wuxia films. But somehow Mulan’s assets don’t coalesce into a thrilling whole. It’s certainly significant that there is a big Disney film with a Chinese actor, Liu Yifei, as its star. But watching Mulan, one gets the sense that this triumph of representation was considered enough—like the job was done once casting was finished, and everything else was just mechanical detail. Mulan deserves better, as does Liu, as do eager audiences.

Would that some of that magic had been applied elsewhere. Mulan’s choppy script, from four credited writers, has no time for flights of fancy or emotional depth. Instead it hurries us through the basic beats of Mulan’s story, from humble village girl bound for arranged marriage to military hero of the empire, and, after some just-fine battle sequences, dumps us out at the end, gesturing heavily toward an impressiveness it never actually conjured. Though Liu holds her scenes well, we barely even know Mulan. She’s a mere cipher—an emblem with which a huge studio can pat itself on the back, proud to offer this lukewarm plate of inspirational content before moving on to the next whatever.

Title: Cinderella review – straight-faced sentimentality
Publication Source/Venue: The Guardian, Mar. 29. 2015. 4:00PM
URL: https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/29/cinderella-review-straight-faced-sentimentality-kenneth-branagh
Top 5 Words: Disney, Cinderella, ravishing, fairytale, old-fashioned
Summary: This article gives a review on Disney’s recent Cinderella remake. The author comments that the movie has stayed true to the original bringing back the old-fashioned world that Cinderella was set in. This article, like the first document gives a review on Disney remake of a classic. 


There’s always been a fairytale element to Kenneth Branagh’s directing career; the question of whether or not he’ll go to the ball tends to hang over all his movies, right up until the clock strikes 12. One of Branagh’s finest fantasy flicks, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, was as cruelly treated as any of Charles Perrault’s fabled heroines, while the marvellously Ken Russell-esque The Magic Flute signally failed to be showered with riches or made the belle of any box-office ball. Meanwhile, the Hitchcock pastiche Dead Again went from being a copper-bottomed catastrophe to a Stateside hit after an 11th-hour sprinkling of fairy dust (in the form of reprocessed black-and-white flashbacks) turned it from pauper to princess. Most remarkably, Branagh took the straw of Marvel’s Thor comic strip and spun from it the gold of a surprisingly witty blockbuster (Transformers meets Xanadu), a remarkable feat of movie magic.

And so to Cinderella, a live-action reboot of one of Disney’s most enduring animations (the credits cite their “Cinderella properties” alongside Perrault), notable for its straight-faced sentimentality and unfashionable absence of post-Enchanted irony. While Maleficent and Into the Woods unpicked their fairytale roots, Chris Weitz’s screenplay is almost radically anti-revisionist in its refusal to rewrite familiar tropes. This is an unashamedly old-fashioned world of pumpkin coaches, glass slippers and chimes-at-midnight transformations. Why, Cinders even talks to the tiny mice who are the only friends in her coal-scuttle existence; I half expected her to burst into a chorus of A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes. Resisting modern urban updates, Branagh thus returns us to the strange netherworld of European folklore and Disney Americana upon which the House of Mouse was built. If that sounds fantastically unexciting, a $132m worldwide opening proves that Branagh’s “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” instincts were entirely on the money.

What has proved problematic are the gender politics, with stories of Downton Abbey’s Lily James employing a “liquid diet” to pour herself into Sandy Powell’s tightly corseted costumes provoking controversy about negative body images, paradoxically reducing talk of her performance to discussions of her waistline. Yet while this throwback Cinderella may not enjoy the questing action-adventure of the ass-kicking heroines of Brave or Frozen (the Frozen Fever short provides a crowd-pulling curtain-raiser), she is more independent-spirited than her critics have acknowledged. Living by her mother’s deathbed mantra “Have courage and be kind”, this lonely girl is unimpressed by wealth (she falls not for a prince but an “apprentice” whom she meets on equal ground), unimpeded by fear (she outrides the royal hunt in defence of a befriended stag), and undaunted by the spectacular cruelty of her step-family.

Top 5 Words: Disney, Aladdin, exploitation, weird, stereotypes
Summary: This article gives a review on Disney’s recent Aladdin remake. The author mentions that most of the movie was done with the main focus being to gain profits from its various brands. There is nothing memorable about the movie and the racial and cultural stereotypes created various problems. 


“Aladdin,” the 1992 cartoon feature with Robin Williams as a garrulous blue genie, may not be the best movie from Disney’s second golden age of animation, but like the others it has durable charms and memorable songs. “Aladdin,” the new live-action re-whatever with a blue Will Smith popping out of the lamp, may not be the worst product of the current era of legacy intellectual property exploitation (it’s likely that the worst is yet to come), but like most of the others it invites a simple question: Why?

The answer — spoiler alert: “money” — may not surprise you. I know it’s pointless to complain about Disney’s drive to wring every last dollar from its various brands. You might as well complain about the animal sidekicks (and I will). But the movie itself, while not entirely terrible — a lot of craft has been purchased, and even a little art — is pointless in a particularly aggressive way.


The studio’s earlier cash-grab strategy was to protect the classic status of its “A” material through managed scarcity and lavish reissuing. Each new micro-generation of viewers could be initiated into fandom with a bit of ceremony: Here was an old thing that was being passed on to you in a shiny new package, a polished heirloom in the form of a special VHS or DVD edition or a limited run in theaters. What had belonged to your parents and grandparents could also be yours, whether it was “Snow White” or “The Little Mermaid.” (Not anymore with “Song of the South,” though.)


There were problems with this approach, including the preservation of tropes and images that came to seem old-fashioned, and not necessarily in a good way. The patriarchal princess stories. The cultural and racial stereotypes. That kind of thing. But Disney, long committed to doing well by meaning well, has synergized evolving social attitudes with advancing digital technology to concoct a series of updates.

None of these have surpassed the original, but that might be too much to ask. I can’t think of one — not “The Jungle Book”; not “Mary Poppins Returns”; not the recent, somber “Dumbo”; certainly not this “Aladdin” — that seems able to stand alone in the popular imagination. They are weird and grotesque hybrids, belonging to no particular era, style or creative sensibility, like dishes at a chain restaurant that fuse disparate food trends to produce flavors alien to every known earthly cuisine.

“Aladdin” is not a cartoon, but it takes place in cartoonlike spaces that trade the grace and flow of animation for the cold literalism of computer-generated imagery. The animal sidekicks — a mischievous monkey, a loyal tiger and a malignant parrot — are neither cute nor especially realistic. The human beings occupying the frame alongside them look, with the partial exception of the genie, like people dressed up as Disney characters. They run and jump and dance and sing and wear excruciatingly bright costumes, almost never memorably.",title aladdin review this is not what you wished for publication source venue the new york times

Title: Review: ‘Beauty and the Beast’ Revels in Joy and Enchantment
Publication Source/Venue: The New York Times, Mar. 3. 2017.

Top 5 Words: classicism, Disney, familiar, enchanted, vivid
Summary: This article reviews the Disney remake of ‘Beauty and the Beast’. The author praises the movie saying that it has retained the enchantment and classicism that was present in the original. This article was chosen because it reviewed yet another Disney remake. 

To quote a lyric from one of the songs in “Beauty and the Beast,” “there may be something there that wasn’t there before.” The familiar elements are all in place, of course. It’s “Beauty and the Beast,” for goodness’ sake: a tale as old as time, a song as old as rhyme and all that. And there are inspired flights of nostalgia as well, visual evocations of the predigital glory of Busby Berkeley, Ray Harryhausen and other masters of fantastical craft.
But this live-action/digital hybrid, directed by Bill Condon and starring Emma Watson and Dan Stevens in the title roles, is more than a flesh-and-blood (and prosthetic fur-and-horns) revival of the 26-year-old cartoon, and more than a dutiful trip back to the pop-culture fairy-tale well. Its classicism feels unforced and fresh. Its romance neither winks nor panders. It looks good, moves gracefully and leaves a clean and invigorating aftertaste. I almost didn’t recognize the flavor: I think the name for it is joy.
This was by no means a foregone conclusion. The reanimation of beloved properties — to use the grim business nomenclature of Hollywood — often leads to hack work and zombie-ism, as old archetypes are shocked to life and arrayed in garish, synthetic modern effects. That might easily have happened here. Look (I mean: don’t look) at the horrors that have been visited, in recent years, on Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan and the Wizard of Oz. And even if Disney had done a more convincing upgrade, on the model of last year’s “Jungle Book,” a new “Beauty” could have offended fans of the 1991 animated feature simply by existing. That movie, a high point of the ’80s and ’90s Disney revival, is close to perfect. What singing teapot would dare to challenge Angela Lansbury?
The only possible answer is Emma Thompson, whose Mrs. Potts is joined by other household objects with the voices (and, briefly, the faces) of movie stars. Stanley Tucci and Audra McDonald are the excitable harpsichord and the operatic wardrobe; Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen are the suave candelabra and the anxious clock. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is the lissome feather duster. Their singing and banter is so vivid and so natural that you almost take for granted that they appear to be mechanical objects clicking and whirling in physical space, sharing the frame with human characters.
It’s Disney! Which means there will also be a villain and a comical sidekick, who steal many scenes on the way to their comeuppance. That would be Gaston (Luke Evans), a narcissistic cabbage-stomping former soldier and his adoring pal LeFou (Josh Gad). Gaston is sweet on Belle, and his excitement at her unambiguous refusals makes him the film’s avatar of nastiness. No redemption here. He goes from annoying to evil when he stirs up the anti-intellectualism and xenophobia of a populist mob to serve his own egomaniacal ends. The residents of the castle fight back because their humanity is at stake. It’s just a fairy tale.

Title: Film Review: Tim Burton’s ‘Dumbo’
Publication Source/Venue: Variety, Mar. 26. 2019. 9:01 AM

Top 5 Words: Disney, parable, emotional, cracked, wonderstruck
Summary: This article reviews the Disney remake of ‘Dumbo’. The author comments saying that the original Dumbo left viewers in awe with feelings of joy but the remake take’s a new twist and tells the story of an animal being exploited by a showman. 

The key image in Walt Disney’s 1941 “Dumbo” is something out of a fairy-tale daydream: Dumbo, the baby elephant with long-lashed goo-goo eyes, a cuddly grin, and ears as long and floppy as wings, flapping those ears to soar around a circus big top, flying over the crowds with a freedom as touching as it is inexplicable. It’s one of the purest images in movies. “Dumbo” was Disney’s fourth animated feature (after “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” “Pinocchio,” and “Fantasia”), and like Dumbo himself it’s a beautiful oddball — a solid-colored piece of stylized pop Americana, only 64 minutes long, at times almost a silent movie with sound effects. One of the more remarkable things about it is that Dumbo, after being cruelly separated from his mother (a primal twist that anticipates “Bambi”), doesn’t discover his ability to fly until the last six minutes of the movie. When he does, he becomes a creature as enchanted in his yearning and escape as King Kong up on the Empire State Building or E.T. hoisting a bicycle into the sky. In “Dumbo,” the magic of Dumbo’s ability to fly comes at the audience like a heavenly afterthought, one that tosses us into the sublime and leaves us there.
The flying sequences in Tim Burton’s “Dumbo,” a live-action reimagining of the Disney classic, have a touch of that same wonderstuck quality. Dumbo, now created with animatronic and digital effects, is still a cute, lonely pachyderm with impossibly large floppy ears who speaks to us with his soft pleading anthropomorphic Keane eyes (he has no dialogue.) When he’s slathered in clown make-up and forced to stand on top of a towering circus platform, his fear and humiliation are palpable. Then, after ingesting a feather into his trunk  he plunges downward and takes wing, and for a few moments you feel your heart soaring along with his.
But in the new “Dumbo,” our hero’s happy-sad flights of fancy aren’t the emotional culmination of the movie; they start early on and happen periodically, to gradually lesser effect. A bulgy little elephant, as suffused with feeling as a silent-movie clown, lofting himself into the air: That’s still a marvelous image. But the new “Dumbo” is a meandering parable about the world’s attempt to corrupt it.
Dumbo is born into a barnstorming circus run by the scuzzy carny barker Max Medici (Danny DeVito), who gets bought out by V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton), an entrepreneur in a silvery wig so ornate it makes Andy Warhol’s look organic. Vandevere believes in the go-big-or-go-home school of entertainment. The year is 1919, and his “circus” is really the world’s first theme park, a place called Dreamland that’s as packed with rides, exhibits, and chicanery as a small city. He’s not a showman; he’s an exploiter. He looks at Dumbo and sees a gold mine, and he doesn’t deliver the elephant’s gift in all its cracked glory so much as he squeezes the wonder out of it through packaging.

Title: The Jungle Book review – spectacular revival of Disney’s family favorite
Publication Source/Venue: The Guardian, Apr. 12. 2016. 9:53 EDT
URL: https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/12/the-jungle-book-review
Top 5 Words: Disney, Mowgli, spectacular, witty, spirit
Summary: This article reviews the Disney remake of The Jungle Book. The author claims that this new movie retains the spirit of the original Disney movie and is comparable to the original masterpiece. The author gives praise for the actors, digital rendering, and ease of story-telling. 

What on earth is the point of remaking Walt Disney’s great and possibly greatest masterpiece, the glorious animated musical from 1967, based on Kipling’s tales, all about the “man cub” Mowgli, brought up by wolves in the Indian jungle – famously the last film to get Disney’s personal touch? A remake which furthermore leaves old-fashioned animation behind, departing for the live-action uncanny valley of hyperreal CGI, which heretically loses most of the songs and which also abandons the original’s final, unforgettably exotic glimpse of a real-life human girl?
Well, no point really … other than simply to create a terrifically enjoyable piece of old-fashioned storytelling and a beautiful-looking film: spectacular, exciting, funny and fun. It handsomely revives the spirit of Disney’s original film, while also having something of old-school family movies about animals like The Incredible Journey (1963) – it almost feels like something I could have watched as a kid on TV. Yet also, weirdly, there’s a touch of Mel Gibson’s jungle nightmare Apocalypto (2006).

Perhaps most strikingly of all, it re-imports into the story elements of the Disney classic The Lion King (1994) which The Jungle Book influenced in the first place: there’s a special rock for the animals to gather round, a stampede scene and an evil feline with a facial disfigurement.
Newcomer Neel Sethi plays Mowgli himself; Ben Kingsley voices Bagheera the panther; Idris Elba is the evil tiger Shere Khan; Scarlett Johansson is the hissing snake mesmerist Kaa; Christopher Walken is the voice of King Louie the fire-hungry ape and inevitably – but pleasingly, and very amusingly – Bill Murray is an outstanding vocal turn as the notorious ursine slacker and pleasure-seeker Baloo the bear who teaches Mowgli the importance of kicking back and enjoying the bare necessities of life.
I’ve never seen digital rendering of talking animals look so persuasive and this film also creates witty and ingenious twists on the story we all know, including a new plot development concerning wolf-leader Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Shere Khan – and even creates a backstory for Mowgli which explains how he got that modesty-preserving loincloth of his.
It’s not a musical and yet the deployment of two famous songs – The Bare Necessities and I Wanna Be Like You – feels easy and natural. Actually, the film emphatically revives Kipling’s poem The Law of the Jungle with its collective all-for-one ethic: “The strength of the pack is the wolf/And the strength of the wolf is the pack.” Baloo prefers songs to poems and calls that one “propaganda”.
Interestingly, where the first film finally sticks to a never-the-twain-shall-meet attitude to humans’ long-term cohabitation with animals, this one posits the idea of living together happily (though that size of loincloth can’t last for ever). As I said, this sacrifices the original’s bittersweet acknowledgment that Mowgli must one day grow up and look for romance.

But what a tremendous success this is. The Jungle Book 2.0 is the unexpected treat of the week.

greatest masterpiece the glorious animated musical from based on kipling s tales all about the man cub mowgli brought up by wolves in the indian jungle famously the last film to get disney s personal touch a remake which furthermore leaves old fashioned animation behind departing for the live action uncanny valley of hyperreal cgi which heretically loses most of the songs and which also abandons the original s final unforgettably exotic glimpse of a real life human girl well no point really other than simply to create a terrifically enjoyable piece of old fashioned storytelling and a beautiful looking film spectacular exciting funny and fun it handsomely revives the spirit of disney s original film while also having something of old school family movies about animals like the incredible journey it almost feels like something i could have watched as a kid on tv yet also weirdly there s a touch of mel gibson s jungle nightmare apocalypto perhaps most strikingly of all it re imports into the story elements of the disney classic the lion king which the jungle book influenced in the first place there s a special rock for the animals to gather round a stampede scene and an evil feline with a facial disfigurement newcomer neel sethi plays mowgli himself ben kingsley voices bagheera the panther idris elba is the evil tiger shere khan scarlett johansson is the hissing snake mesmerist kaa christopher walken is the voice of king louie the fire hungry ape and inevitably but pleasingly and very amusingly bill murray is an outstanding vocal turn as the notorious ursine slacker and pleasure seeker baloo the bear who teaches mowgli the importance of kicking back and enjoying the bare necessities of life i ve never seen digital rendering of talking animals look so persuasive and this film also creates witty and ingenious twists on the story we all know including a new plot development concerning wolf leader akela giancarlo esposito and shere khan and even creates a backstory for mowgli which explains how he got that modesty preserving loincloth of his it s not a musical and yet the deployment of two famous songs the bare necessities and i wanna be like you feels easy and natural actually the film emphatically revives kipling s poem the law of the jungle with its collective all for one ethic the strength of the pack is the wolf and the strength of the wolf is the pack baloo prefers songs to poems and calls that one propaganda interestingly where the first film finally sticks to a never the twain shall meet attitude to humans long term cohabitation with animals this one posits the idea of living together happily though that size of loincloth can t last for ever as i said this sacrifices the original s bittersweet acknowledgment that mowgli must one day grow up and look for romance but what a tremendous success this is the jungle book is the unexpected treat of the week ,0.9983,Positive,0,"['jungle', 'book', 'review', 'revival',

Top 5 Words: Disney, Alice, grim, dark, nightmarish
Summary: This article reviews the Disney remake of Alice in Wonderland. The author comments on how Tim Burton turned this movie into a dark and grim story while eliminating the personality of the main character, Alice. 

Into the dark you tumble in “Alice in Wonderland,” Tim Burton’s busy, garish and periodically amusing repo of the Lewis Carroll hallucination “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” It’s a long fall turned long haul, despite the Burtonian flourishes  the pinch of cruelty, the mordant wit  that animate the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and the porker that slides under her feet with a squeal. “I love a warm pig belly for my aching feet,” the queen tells Alice. Played by Mia Wasikowska, Alice looks a touch dazed: she seems to have left her pulse above ground when she fell down the rabbit hole of Mr. Burton’s imagination.
Mr. Burton has done his best work with contemporary stories, so it’s curious if not curiouser that he’s turned his sights on another 19th-century tale. Perhaps after slitting all those throats in his adaptation of “Sweeney Todd,” he thought he would chop off a few heads. Whatever his inspiration, he has tackled this new story with his customary mix of torpor and frenzy. After a short glance back at Alice’s childhood and an equally brief look at her present, he sends the 19-year-old on her way, first down the hole and then into a dreamscape  unfortunately tricked out with 3-D that distracts more than it delights  where she meets a grinning cat and a lugubrious caterpillar, among other fantastical creatures.
Dark and sometimes grim, this isn’t your great-grandmother’s Alice or that of Uncle Walt, who was disappointed with the 1951 Disney version of “Alice in Wonderland.” “Alice has no character,” said a writer who worked on that project. “She merely plays straight man to a cast of screwball comics.” Of course the character of Carroll’s original Alice is evident in each outrageous creation she dreams up in “Wonderland” and in the sequel, “Through the Looking-Glass,” which means that she’s a straight man to her own imagination. (She is Wonderland.) Here she mostly serves as a foil for the top biller Johnny Depp, who (yes, yes) plays the Mad Hatter, and Mr. Burton’s bright and leaden whimsies.
Since narrative momentum isn’t Mr. Burton’s strength, “Alice in Wonderland” probably seemed a good fit for him, and there are moments when his transparent delight in the material lifts the movie and even carries it forward. His Wonderland (here, Underland) isn’t inviting or attractive. The colors are often bilious, though the palette also turns gunmetal gray, bringing to mind “Sweeney Todd.” There’s a suggestively nightmarish aspect to Alice’s journey, as when she steps on some severed heads in the Red Queen’s moat as if they were stones. The queen herself is a horror: Bette Davis as Elizabeth I and reconfigured as a bobble-head doll. Ms. Bonham Carter makes you hear the petulant child in her barbarism and the wounded woman too. She rocks the house and the movie.

A.F.O."" monograms on presidential hand towels show how much the little things count in Wolfgang Petersen's fast-paced, red-blooded action movie ""Air Force One."" Small niceties aboard the presidential plane set the tone for a larger amenity: the brave, tough, decent commander in chief.
As played in warmly electable fashion by Harrison Ford, President James Marshall is pure paragon, a statesman of strong backbone who kisses his wife even when no one's looking. When Ford waves to admirers while boarding the president's airplane, he has no trouble looking every inch the star. But the inspiration stops just beyond the man himself, who amounts to the summer's most enjoyable special effect, and beyond voyeurism about how he travels.
""Air Force One"" otherwise offers what has begun to seem routine excitement: crazed terrorists, midair dogfights, desperate struggles staged beside an airplane's open door. And dialogue bristling with manful military authority: ""Let's not waste any more time. Send the Nimitz back in.""
Honestly, who ever meant to feel this jaded? But this season's blockbusters have unfolded at such fever pitch that a presidential hijacking in one more airplane thriller has an aspect of deja vu. Petersen, known for the efficient and vigorously muscular action of ""Das Boot"" and ""In the Line of Fire,"" once again directs with galvanizing intensity, but the relentlessness of these thrills carries little in the way of surprise. The season's hottest, looniest, most gripping adventure remains ""Face/Off"" from the more luridly audacious John Woo.
Despite the seals and monograms that make it so specially Presidential, the blunt, high-octane ""Air Force One"" recalls ""Executive Decision,"" ""Con Air"" and all the other scary airborne thrillers that no real plane will ever dare show in flight. In an added flourish to make Tom Clancy blush, it has a plot concerning the dread return of Communism to the Russian empire. Andrew W. Marlowe's screenplay begins with a commando raid in Kazakhstan that captures a scheming, dangerous general (played nearly wordlessly by Jurgen Prochnow of ""Das Boot""). To free their leader, a group of radical Russians masquerades as a news crew to board and then take over Air Force One.
The film's mustache twirler of a villain is played with scary glee by Gary Oldman, who rhapsodizes about Mother Russia while trying to guess where President Marshall is hiding. Cleverly concealed aboard Air Force One during much of the movie, the president even finds ways to contact White House personnel on the ground.
Turns out the president of the United States can have as much trouble with telephone operators or cell phone batteries as anybody else.
Meanwhile, lest ""Air Force One"" be confused with anything ordinary, Petersen stages some furiously energetic airborne sequences starring the painted 747 that plays the title role. Thanks to the official cooperation of the United States military, this Hollywood valentine to dashing Presidential style also features real F-15's, Blackhawk helicopters, C-130 cargo planes and other huge pieces of hardware, which were maintained by a large corps of military personnel (numbering about 250) on the Sony payroll.",title air force one review authors janet maslin source date new york

Authors: Desson Howe
Source/Date: Washington Post, August 5th 1994  
URL: 'Clear and Present Danger' (washingtonpost.com)
Keywords: Harrison Ford, Tom Clancy, Jack Ryan, Patriot Games, The Hunt For Red October, CIA, Washington, America, CIA, Analyst, agent, Colombian, drug, cartel

""Clear and Present Danger"" feels like a recurring dream, a deja vu of a movie. The third film to be adapted from novelist Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series (after ""The Hunt for Red October"" and ""Patriot Games""), it offers the usual round of situation-room anxiety at the CIA, shady maneuverings in Washington power corridors and secret battles with foreign adversaries. And once again, dependably resourceful Ryan (played a second time by Harrison Ford) fights for truth, justice and the American Way.
In this story, CIA analyst/agent Ford is stuck with a desk job. His old lion of a mentor (James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer) is dying and needs a worthy successor. While Jones lies in a VA hospital, Ford -- now the CIA's acting deputy director -- finds himself assuring stern congresswoman Hope Lange that the Company's request for funds to assist the Colombian government against the drug cartels will not involve troops.
Only later does Ford realize someone on his side is using the taxpayers' lucre for covert military operations. Infuriated that he was being used (heroes can be so dumb), Ford decides to fly to Colombia himself to straighten things out. At that point, the movie goes into Chuck Norris mode: Americans are being held prisoner in foreign cells. Treacherous drug manufacturers abound. 
For what it is, ""Clear and Present Danger"" is fun to sit through. Director Phillip Noyce (who helmed ""Patriot Games"") keeps the action crisp and varied in this post-James Bond drug-cartel scenario. But if the movie doesn't lose the entertaining pace set by its predecessors, it does little to break free of the pack. Screenwriters Donald Stewart, Steven Zaillian and John Milius can't completely freshen the over-familiarity, as the U.S. government tiptoes around Congress to battle Colombian drug merchants, a renegade CIA operations deputy director (Henry Czerny) does business with mysterious field operatives and a national security adviser (Harris Yulin) seems to be the guy really running things in the White House.
There's nothing ""wrong"" with this movie but it feels like warmed-over business as usual. Not counting the returnees -- Ford as Ryan, Anne Archer as his wife (again) and Jones as Greer (for the third time) -- everybody seems to be replaying roles from other movies. Yulin, Miguel Sandoval (a drug emperor called Ernesto Escobedo), Donald Moffat (possibly the screen's most buffoonish president in a non-comedy) and others come across as minimally reworked spy-movie cliches.
As for the state-of-the-art hardware, it feels like the slick version of old hat. There's an air-launched missile (guided partially by CIA operative Willem Dafoe on a PC) that glides down to its Colombian target ""Dr. Strangelove""-style. There's voice-matching software that helps Ford finger a bad guy who made the mistake of leaving a message on his victim's answering machine. Even the dialogue seems reproduced from somewhere. When Dafoe asks Czerny what the American government wants, the CIA deputy answers: ""They want what every first-term administration wants: A second term."" It's smart-aleck banter. But we've heard it before.

When it comes to submarines, boys will always be boys—end of the Cold War be damned. ""Crimson Tide,"" starring Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington, is about trembling hands clutching nuclear-bombing codes, sweating crew-members crossing themselves, and clocks counting the world's final minutes. The scenario may be dumb and predictable, with a wimpy ending to boot, but it's also sort of fun.
When a rebel Russian leader seizes a missile base and threatens to blow up the United States and Japan, the American government puts a nuclear submarine on major alert. While monastic choral voices serenade them on the soundtrack, war-mongering skipper Hackman and his sensitive-but-strong lieutenant commander Washington board the USS Alabama and hunt for post-Reds in October.
As the submarine propels its way towards the possible outbreak of World War III, Hackman and Washington duke with each other like Captain Bligh and Fletcher Christian. Their conflict is, naturally, the best element in the movie. Washington can feel the pulse of the crew, believes that war is not a good thing, and loves Arabian horses. With that soft-centered steeliness, he makes an appealing, by-the-book hero. Hackman believes in Jack Russells, simple destruction of the enemy and speaking harshly with a big stick. And as usual, he chuckles his way through evil, so that you fear him and like him all at once.
Their dueling ideologies come into sharper focus when an EAM—an electronic message from the Pentagon—orders them to load up and get ready to fire. Hackman needs no second bidding. (""Hope you enjoyed the peace,"" he tells the crew at the beginning of the mission, ""because, as of now, we're back in business."")
But when a second, garbled EAM comes in—its message unclear—the captain decides to stay on course. Washington, who doesn't want to destroy the world with that nagging feeling that he didn't have to, insists on finding out what the second message said. The trouble is—and here's where you have to dunk your disbelief—the radio system dies. And in the deep, there are no pay phones. As Hackman and Washington have at each other, the crew (including George Dzundza and Viggo Mortensen) is bounced uncertainly in between.
This '90s belligerency feels almost sentimental. Michael Schiffer's script repeddles elements from ""The Hunt for Red October,"" ""Fail Safe,"" ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Mutiny on the Bounty."" The movie's a reunion of director Tony Scott and producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson—the testosteronal trio that gave you ""Top Gun,"" ""Beverly Hills Cop II"" and ""Days of Thunder."" And once again, we're asked to regard Russians as Klingons and fear the threat of a glowing holocaust. But there's always something involving about underwater tussles of will, and ""Crimson"" is satisfyingly buffed up to look new. It's no effort to take the dive.

Keywords: Sean Connery, Captain, Soviet, Submarine, Red October, United States, sonar, captain, Alec Baldwin, Hunt, Tom Clancy, Russian

Very early in 'The Hunt for Red October,' Marko Ramius (Sean Connery), the captain of a new, atomic-powered, top-of-the-line Soviet submarine named the Red October, barehandedly murders a fellow officer aboard ship. The captain seems to be mad. He's been reading about Armageddon and it's known that he has been despondent ever since his wife died. Good grief - a maniac in charge of a ship equipped with enough missiles to wipe out virtually every major city in the United States! What's worse is that the Red October has a new hydropropulsion system, a technological breakthrough, which allows it to escape detection by even the most sophisticated sonar equipment. Only a hotshot sonar engineer would be able to tell the difference between the sounds of the Red October and the mating of whales. It's conceivable that the lunatic captain could remain submerged off Coney Island and incinerate everything between the Ferris wheel and Denver. Is there no hope for mankind? On and off the pulses pound as the mind prepares to reel. John McTiernan's ''Hunt for Red October,'' based on the Tom Clancy suspense novel, begins with a screen note to the effect that the events portrayed took place in November 1984, shortly before Mikhail S. Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union. The note adds, ''Nothing of what you are about to see ever happened.'' It's an elegy for those dear, dark, terrible days of the cold war, when it was either them or us, and before the world had become so thoroughly fractured that it's no longer possible to know exactly who the thems are. It's the kind of movie in which the characters, like the lethal hardware, are simply functions of the plot, which in this case seems to be a lot more complex than it really is. 
Among other revelations, Captain Ramius is not quite the madman he appeared to be at first. The movie's explanation: the captain is Lithuanian, not Russian. Yet the complications accumulate. The Joint Chiefs of Staff meet in Washington to debate whether Captain Ramius is lanning a first assault on the United States, or maybe a defection. Only the audience knows for sure. Washington dispatches Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin), a plucky C.I.A. agent who once met the captain, to the scene of the hunt. The movie dashes from London to Moscow to Washington to the Sea of Murmansk, the time and place of each new sequence announced in computer script that sounds top-secret important as it rat-a-tats onto the screen. At one point, the Red October is being hunted by both the United States and Soviet fleets. The Russians are trying to torpedo their own ship. Aboard the Red October, the atomic reactor is verging on meltdown and a saboteur is trying to destroy the vessel from within. It's both too much and not enough. It's fun in fits and starts, but also sort of lazy. Mr. McTiernan is not a subtle director. Punches are pulled constantly.

Source/Date: Washington Post, July 9th 1993  
URL: 'In the Line of Fire' (washingtonpost.com)
Keywords: Clint Eastwood, Secret Service, President, veteran, JFK assassination, California, John Malkovich

Clint Eastwood is still cleaning the town of punks, varmints and career criminals. But in recent years, that head has become gray. The leathery skin clings even tighter to the skull. The furrows in his face could irrigate Death Valley. But this creeping, hoary condition has made things better. Even the most throwaway roles have become imbued with poignance. He's not just taking on opponents. He's fighting time itself -- the horrible softness of age. And he's doing it for us -- aspiring old farts all.
""In the Line of Fire,"" which has him huffing and puffing next to presidential limousines, is not a brilliant movie. But thanks to Eastwood, it feels like one. As Frank Horrigan, a veteran Secret Service agent in need of redemption, he's in effortless -- and touching -- command. Weathering the ravages of time, and the insults of young-lion colleagues, he means to catch aspiring (and taunting) assassin John Malkovich even if it kills him.
That, increasingly, is the point of this cat-and-mouse movie: Is Eastwood willing to take a bullet for the president? Can he put his life on the line? It's not the deepest thematic concern you ever saw on screen. But it's watchable, great fun. And while Eastwood toils and sweats in the acid test of his life, he still has the juice to joust with fellow agent Rene Russo.
Now working as a field agent, Eastwood has been haunted for 30 years by the JFK assassination -- a tragedy for which he feels responsible. As a young presidential bodyguard, he watched it all happen in a state of shock -- instead of diving in front of the Chief Executive.
Those memories are stirred up when Malkovich, excruciatingly aware of Eastwood's guilt, teasingly challenges the veteran agent to stop him from killing the president. For Eastwood, this is a psychic second chance. But Malkovich is a master of elusiveness and Eastwood, who has a habit of rubbing his colleagues (and presidential clients) the wrong way, keeps getting pushed away from the action.
As the movie progresses to its high-climax showdown -- when the president makes an election-eve speech in California -- things reach their predictable zenith of dramatic exaggeration. But Eastwood's so stately to watch, and Malkovich's so wonderfully over the top (imagine William Shatner playing Bruno in ""Strangers on a Train""), you swallow all the implausibilities.
Malkovich, who leaves a trail of bodies as he stalks the president, likes to tantalize Eastwood by phone with new riddles, threats and pearls of wisdom. At one point, he tells Eastwood (whom he calls ""Frank"" with eerie familiarity), he shouldn't feel so bad about the JFK thing. After all, he asserts, Kennedy had a death wish. ""His favorite poem was 'A Rendezvous With Death,' which is not a good poem, Frank.""
We meet Eastwood playing undercover among a clutch of drug dealers. When things suddenly turn sour, Eastwood -- surrounded by three armed bad guys -- has to take evasive measures.

Given the creative recession in the movies, you could do worse than sit through ""Patriot Games."" If this would-be blockbuster slavishly follows summer movie guidelines, it does so well -- or adequately. Neither poisonous nor great, it never loses sight of its mall-movie mandate, to defend American hearth and home against invincible boy-toy bogymen.
In this very loose adaptation of the Tom Clancy novel (which the author publicly lambasted), inactive CIA analyst Harrison Ford, wife Anne Archer and daughter Thora Birch find themselves the nuclear-family target of a vengeful Irish terrorist. On vacation with his family in London, Ford heroically intervenes in an assassination attempt on royal family member James Fox.
In the melee, Ford kills the baby brother of mega-assassin Sean Bean. That's bad. That's very bad. Now Ford and Archer have to watch their backs for a man with no regard for human life or clean shaving techniques.
The movie, which flits around the globe, is an extended set of climaxes posing as a story. There's a bomb explosion in London, deadly traffic trouble on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, an aerial attack in North Africa and -- scariest of all -- tension in a Belfast pub.
""Games"" also indulges in gee-whiz modern warfare. Rejoining the CIA, Ford searches for Bean and fellow terrorists Patrick Bergin and Polly Walker with satellite surveillance. Using sophisticated image magnification (the way he did in ""Blade Runner""), Ford finds he can identify a woman's bust line in the Sahara all the way from Langley, Va. He even gets to watch the ""neutralization"" of an enemy camp over there, live.
""It's over,"" says CIA spymaster James Earl Jones, who runs overseas reprisals like a kindly family dentist performing a minor tooth extraction.
The state-of-the-art cat-and-mousing is there to parboil the vigilante emotions before the predictable finale -- which will be held chez Ford. By that time, the stakes have become so high, Archer (an intelligent doctor) tells her husband: ""You get him. I don't care what you have to do -- just get him."" Reaching later for the trusty family rifle, she complains, ""Oh God, Jack, what did you do with the shells?""
Paramount Pictures (hoping to make more Clancy movies) asks you to enjoy -- and overlook -- the hyping of everything. For one thing, Bean's terrorist outfit (a breakaway faction of the IRA) has an operating budget the Pentagon would die for. They have top-of-the-line speedboats, infrared storm-the-fortress equipment, nasty car bombs and the usual glut of machine guns. They have easy access to London cabs and Libyan ships. Of course they're thick as thieves with Moammar Gadhafi.
Director Phillip Noyce, who made the gripping thriller ""Dead Calm,"" has earned his directorial hack license here. With the knowing assistance of scriptwriters Donald Stewart (who did Clancy's ""The Hunt for Red October"") and W. Peter Illif (creator of the ridiculously formulaic ""Point Break""), ""Games"" accomplishes its high-stakes mission.

Keywords: Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones, doctor, covict, murder, Chicago surgeon, execution

The violent death of Dr. Richard Kimble's wife, the mysterious, one-armed assailant who killed her and Kimble's wrongful sentencing to death for the murder -- these elements powered the TV series ""The Fugitive."" Viewers watched for four seasons, as Kimble -- who escaped when the train taking him to his execution crashed -- searched high and low for the killer, always keeping a step ahead of his relentless pursuer, Lt. Gerard.
In the climactic final episode, aired in August 1967, the odyssey came to a resolution on the roof of a high building, in a three-way confrontation among Kimble (David Janssen), mystery man Fred Johnson and Lt. Gerard. The show enjoyed the highest number of viewers for an episode in television history, a record that lasted until the Who-Shot-J. R.? revelation in ""Dallas,"" 13 years later.
Thirty years after the first episode, a movie version of ""The Fugitive,"" starring Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, is making a new run for it -- a great one, too. The times may have passed us by (the late Janssen included), but the excitement's the same. Ford's dilemma remains as humanly charged as ever. Convicted erroneously for the brutal murder of his wife, the Chicago surgeon escapes execution (thanks to a prison bus-commuter train collision), and fights to clear his name and avenge his wife, while evading Jones's particularly tenacious manhunt.
Certainly ""The Fugitive"" is retrofitted for contemporary action-movie standards. Director Andrew Davis (who made two Steven Seagal movies and one Chuck Norris) stages a train wreck to rival Operation Desert Storm.
He also puts Ford through a demanding escape route that requires scrambling through labyrinthine sewer tunnels, jumping from a towering dam, fighting for a gun on Chicago's L train, ducking the feds during a St. Patrick's Day parade and, of course, fighting for his life on rooftops. Ford isn't just intense, intelligent and heroically obsessed. He's pumped with robust physique. A shot of him -- all but nude -- injecting himself to ease the pain of a bullet wound makes an eloquent case for unlimited time with personal trainers.
Meanwhile Jones, as Deputy U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard, enjoys a promotion and first-name change over the series' Lt. Philip Gerard. He's also an over-the-top blast as a hesitation-free perfectionist who suffers fools quippingly and keeps pace with Ford at every turn. As for the mystery man (name withheld for entertainment purposes), he's sporting a state-of-the-art prosthetic arm.
A juggernaut of exaggeration, momentum and thrills -- without a single lapse of subtlety -- ""Fugitive"" is pure energy, a perfect orchestration of heroism, villainy, suspense and comic relief. Ford makes the perfect rider for a project like this, with his hangdog-handsome everyman presence. He's one of us -- but one of us at his personal best.

21,VPD_DOC1_AMELIE.txt,"Paris: a city of light, a city for lovers and the perfect setting for Jean-Pierre Jeunets wonderfully charmingAmlie. With plenty of character and heart, this classic French hit is the dictionary definition of feel good. Amlie is no ordinary woman. Played by the beautifully fresh-faced Audrey Tautou, shes a young woman who discretely orchestrates the lives of the people around her, sorting out their sad little problems. But when she discovers a strange photo album belonging to Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), she soon realises that she is in love and has problems of her own.[Some plot details ahead]Amlie was raised apart from other children; her father, a man obsessed with garden gnomes, misdiagnosed her with a weak heart, while a suicidal person leaping off a building landed on Amlies luckless mother, killing her flat. Amlie observes life at a distance, that is, until the death of Princes Diana leads her to discover a hidden old rusty box, in which a young boy once hoarded his treasures. In tracking down the boy  now a grown man  she returns the box to an overjoyed owner and Amlie, watching in secret, finds her lifes work: she will make people happy. Amusing herself (and us), she devises the most brilliant ways for bringing about their happiness.She plays matchmaker with the lonely tobacconist Georgette (Isabelle Nanty) at the local Parisian cafe, and Joseph (Dominique Pinon), a customer who has been jilted. She comes up with witty ways to get her reclusive father (Rufus) to begin his once-upon-a-time dream of travelling the world. She even stands up for Lucien (Jamel Debbouze), an Arab clerk working at the grocers whos constantly being shamed publicly by his controlling boss (Urbain Cacellier).Amlie explores the simplicity of life, and sees the beauty in almost everything. From the very start of the movie, with her brief, particular and wonderfully distinctive likes and dislikes, you begin to grow attached to her character and progression in the film. The real delight comes later, from the army of oddballs that rotate the relationship Amlie shares with each of the unusual characters she meets. With each character comes a different story, and although I hate to admit it, I consider myself a helpless romantic, so naturally my favourite wasthe love story between Amelie and Nino, whichmy heart swell. While their love story may not be the most conventional, the childlike pranks you see throughout the film make for a playfully romantic adventure.The film, filled with a great cast who embody charm instead of impersonating it, coupled with Jeunets direction, makes exquisite use of Paris as an inviting playground for Amlies missions of kindness. One of the many reasons I love this movie is that the Montmartre Amlie lives in is an unreal, dream version of Paris. What with the accordion music, corner cafes and sepia tones that soak through panoramic shots of the city, this supposedly modern-day Paris Jeunet tries to create for us, could most certainly be the Paris of 30 years before.",paris a city of light a city for lovers and the perfect setting for jean pierre jeunets wonderfully charmingamlie with plenty of character and heart this classic french hit is the dictionary definition of feel good amlie is no ordinary woman played by the beautifully fresh faced audrey tautou shes a young woman who discretely orchestrates the lives of the people around her sorting out their sad little problems but when she discovers a strange photo album belonging to nino mathieu kassovitz she soon realises that she is in love and has problems of her own some plot details ahead amlie was raised apart from other children her father a man obsessed with garden gnomes misdiagnosed her with a weak heart while a suicidal person leaping off a building landed on amlies luckless mother killing her flat amlie observes life at a distance that is until the death of princes diana leads her to discover a hidden old rusty box in which a young boy once hoarded his treasures in tracking down the boy now a grown man she returns the box to an overjoyed owner and amlie watching in secret finds her lifes work she will make people happy amusing herself and us she devises the most brilliant ways for bringing about their happiness she plays matchmaker with the lonely tobacconist georgette isabelle nanty at the local parisian cafe and joseph dominique pinon a customer who has been jilted she comes up with witty ways to get her reclusive father rufus to begin his once upon a time dream of travelling the world she even stands up for lucien jamel debbouze an arab clerk working at the grocers whos constantly being shamed publicly by his controlling boss urbain cacellier amlie explores the simplicity of life and sees the beauty in almost everything from the very start of the movie with her brief particular and wonderfully distinctive likes and dislikes you begin to grow attached to her character and progression in the film the real delight comes later from the army of oddballs that rotate the relationship amlie shares with each of the unusual characters she meets with each character comes a different story and although i hate to admit it i consider myself a helpless romantic so naturally my favourite wasthe love story between amelie and nino whichmy heart swell while their love story may not be the most conventional the childlike pranks you see throughout the film make for a playfully romantic adventure the film filled with a great cast who embody charm instead of impersonating it coupled with jeunets direction makes exquisite use of paris as an inviting playground for amlies missions of kindness one of the many reasons i love this movie is that the montmartre amlie lives in is an unreal dream version of paris what with the accordion music corner cafes and sepia tones that soak through panoramic shots of the city this supposedly modern day paris jeunet tries to create for us could most certainly be the paris of years before ,0.9981,Positive,0,"['city', 'light', 'city', 'lovers', 'setting', 'jean', 'pierre', 'jeunets', 'plenty', 'character', 'heart', 'hit', 'definition', 'amlie', 'woman', 'audrey', 'tautou', 'woman', 'lives', 'people', 'problems', 'photo', 'album', 'mathieu', 'kassovitz', 'love', 'problems', 'plot', 'details', 'amlie', 'children', 'father', 'man', 'garden', 'gnomes', 'heart', 'person', 'building', 'amlies', 'mother', 'amlie', 'life', 'distance', 'death', 'princes', 'diana', 'box', 'boy', 'treasures', 'boy', 'man', 'box', 'owner', 'amlie', 'lifes', 'work', 'people', 'ways', 'happiness', 'matchmaker', 'tobacconist', 'georgette', 'isabelle', 'cafe', 'joseph', 'dominique', 'pinon', 'customer', 'ways', 'father', 'rufus', 'time', 'dream', 'world', 'lucien', 'jamel', 'debbouze', 'clerk', 'grocers', 'boss', 'amlie', 'simplicity', 'life', 'beauty', 'start', 'movie', 'likes', 'character', 'progression', 'film', 'delight', 'army', 'oddballs', 'relationship', 'amlie', 'shares', 'characters', 'character', 'story', 'wasthe', 'love', 'story', 'whichmy', 'heart', 'swell', 'love', 'story', 'childlike', 'pranks', 'film', 'adventure', 'film', 'cast', 'charm', 'jeunets', 'direction', 'use', 'paris', 'playground', 'amlies', 'missions', 'kindness', 'reasons', 'movie', 'montmartre', 'amlie', 'dream', 'version', 'paris', 'accordion', 'music', 'corner', 'cafes', 'sepia', 'tones', 'shots', 'city', 'day', 'paris', 'jeunet', 'paris', 'years']",1,1,1,0
22,VPD_DOC2_EAT_PRAY_LOVE.txt,"""I wanted to explore one aspect of myself set against the backdrop of each country, in a place that has traditionally done that one thing very well,"" writes Elizabeth Gilbert in her popular memoirEat, Pray, Love. ""I wanted to explore the art of pleasure in Italy, the art of devotion in India, and in Indonesia, the art of balancing the two.""Therein lies the premise and the problem withEat, Pray, Love, at least in its frustrating (and comma-free) screen incarnation: The world exists as a kind of sprawling, full-service spa treatment for the soul, neatly compartmentalized to nourish the senses, the spirit and the heart. Nice therapy if you can swing it.ThoughEat Pray Lovenever loses the sour whiff of unexamined first-world privilege, its heroine does at least immerse herself in different cultures rather than expecting them to adapt to her. As played by a sun-kissed Julia Roberts, Liz has undertaken this adventure partly to open up to new experiences and loosen the vise-grip she's previously maintained over every aspect of her life, and the little tension that surfaces in her journey is owed to the push and pull between her itinerary -- as defined by the book pitch (and advance money) that made it all possible -- and her desire to feel truly unmoored and liberated. That's the essence of a true vacation, and she has to work hard for it.Before Liz ever steps on a plane, events in her life conspire to do all the packing for her. Feeling shackled by a domestic situation she never wanted, Liz enters into a contentious divorce with her flaky husband (Billy Crudup), then immediately throws herself into a go-nowhere rebound fling with a young and none-too-talented actor (a charming James Franco). The book deal affords her an opportunity to flee Manhattan for a year and define herself apart from a relationship for once. Which raises an obvious rhetorical question: Is there any reason for us to tag along on her personal journey?Well, as a sensual experience,Eat Pray Lovefalls squarely in the tradition of other femme-centered cinematic staycations, likeEnchanted AprilorUnder the Tuscan Sun,and certainly it's transporting to watch Roberts consume pizza in Naples or drift along crystalline currents off the coast of Bali.She also encounters a few fascinating seekers in her travels, including a prickly old Texan (Richard Jenkins), whom she befriends at an Indian ashram and a Brazilian businessman in Indonesia, played by Javier Bardemat his most devastatingly suave. In the film's travel-brochure paradise, they make for agreeable companions.Trouble is, we're still stuck with Liz, who never passes up the chance to process her encounters into Oprah-fied nuggets of wisdom. At her worst, she's like a narcissistic tour guide who invites sightseers to marvel at the spectacular vistas and cascading waters inside her own head. Much asEat Pray Loveis about letting go, Liz's habit of imposing pop-psychological significance on every encounter suggests she's still her controlling self.", i wanted to explore one aspect of myself set against the backdrop of each country in a place that has traditionally done that one thing very well writes elizabeth gilbert in her popular memoireat pray love i wanted to explore the art of pleasure in italy the art of devotion in india and in indonesia the art of balancing the two therein lies the premise and the problem witheat pray love at least in its frustrating and comma free screen incarnation the world exists as a kind of sprawling full service spa treatment for the soul neatly compartmentalized to nourish the senses the spirit and the heart nice therapy if you can swing it thougheat pray lovenever loses the sour whiff of unexamined first world privilege its heroine does at least immerse herself in different cultures rather than expecting them to adapt to her as played by a sun kissed julia roberts liz has undertaken this adventure partly to open up to new experiences and loosen the vise grip she s previously maintained over every aspect of her life and the little tension that surfaces in her journey is owed to the push and pull between her itinerary as defined by the book pitch and advance money that made it all possible and her desire to feel truly unmoored and liberated that s the essence of a true vacation and she has to work hard for it before liz ever steps on a plane events in her life conspire to do all the packing for her feeling shackled by a domestic situation she never wanted liz enters into a contentious divorce with her flaky husband billy crudup then immediately throws herself into a go nowhere rebound fling with a young and none too talented actor a charming james franco the book deal affords her an opportunity to flee manhattan for a year and define herself apart from a relationship for once which raises an obvious rhetorical question is there any reason for us to tag along on her personal journey well as a sensual experience eat pray lovefalls squarely in the tradition of other femme centered cinematic staycations likeenchanted aprilorunder the tuscan sun and certainly it s transporting to watch roberts consume pizza in naples or drift along crystalline currents off the coast of bali she also encounters a few fascinating seekers in her travels including a prickly old texan richard jenkins whom she befriends at an indian ashram and a brazilian businessman in indonesia played by javier bardemat his most devastatingly suave in the film s travel brochure paradise they make for agreeable companions trouble is we re still stuck with liz who never passes up the chance to process her encounters into oprah fied nuggets of wisdom at her worst she s like a narcissistic tour guide who invites sightseers to marvel at the spectacular vistas and cascading waters inside her own head much aseat pray loveis about letting go liz s habit of imposing pop psychological significance on every encounter suggests she s still her controlling self ,0.997,Positive,0,"['aspect', 'backdrop', 'country', 'place', 'thing', 'gilbert', 'memoireat', 'pray', 'love', 'art', 'pleasure', 'italy', 'art', 'devotion', 'india', 'indonesia', 'art', 'premise', 'problem', 'witheat', 'love', 'screen', 'incarnation', 'world', 'kind', 'service', 'spa', 'treatment', 'soul', 'senses', 'spirit', 'heart', 'therapy', 'thougheat', 'pray', 'lovenever', 'whiff', 'world', 'privilege', 'heroine', 'cultures', 'sun', 'julia', 'roberts', 'liz', 'adventure', 'experiences', 'grip', 'aspect', 'life', 'tension', 'surfaces', 'journey', 'push', 'itinerary', 'book', 'pitch', 'money', 'desire', 'essence', 'vacation', 'liz', 'steps', 'plane', 'events', 'life', 'packing', 'feeling', 'situation', 'liz', 'divorce', 'husband', 'go', 'none', 'actor', 'james', 'franco', 'book', 'deal', 'opportunity', 'manhattan', 'year', 'relationship', 'question', 'reason', 'journey', 'experience', 'pray', 'lovefalls', 'tradition', 'staycations', 'sun', 'transporting', 'roberts', 'pizza', 'naples', 'drift', 'crystalline', 'currents', 'coast', 'bali', 'seekers', 'travels', 'richard', 'jenkins', 'ashram', 'businessman', 'indonesia', 'javier', 'film', 'travel', 'brochure', 'paradise', 'companions', 'trouble', 'liz', 'chance', 'encounters', 'oprah', 'nuggets', 'wisdom', 'tour', 'guide', 'sightseers', 'vistas', 'waters', 'head', 'aseat', 'pray', 'loveis', 'liz', 'habit', 'significance', 'encounter', 'self']",1,1,1,0
23,VPD_DOC3_MIDNIGHT_IN_PARIS.txt,"As beguiling as a stroll around Paris on a warm spring evening  something that Owen Wilsons character here becomes very fond of himself  Midnight in Paris represents Woody Allens companion piece to his The Purple Rose of Cairo, a fanciful time machine that allows him to indulge playfully in the artistic Paris of his, and many other peoples, dreams.  A sure-fire source of gentle amusement to Allens core audience but unlikely to connect with those with no knowledge of or feel for the Paris of the Fitzgeralds, Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and Picasso, this love letter to the City of Light looks to do better-than-average business for the writer-director in the U.S. upon its May 20 release, and expectations in certain foreign territories could be even higher.As has happened before when Allen has filmed in photogenic foreign locales  London in Match Point, Barcelona in Vicki Cristina Barcelona  the director seems stimulated by discovering the possibilities of a new environment. In fact, Allen has worked in Paris before, as a writer and actor in Whats New Pussycat? 46 years ago and in one section of Everyone Says I Love You, but this is the first time hes given the city the royal treatment.Granted, its mostly a touristic view of the city, as witness the voluptuously photographed opening montage of famous sites, but thats entirely acceptable given that the leading characters are well-off Americans on vacation. Playing Allens alter ego this time around is Owen Wilson as Gil, a highly successful hack Hollywood screenwriter still young enough to feel pangs over not having seriously tested himself as a novelist.That things may not be entirely right between Gil and his pushy fiance Inez (Rachel McAdams) becomes clear early on, as the couple tours around with Inezs friends Carol (Nina Arianda) and Paul (Michael Sheen), the latter an insufferable expert on all things cultural (that Inezs parents are right-wingers also allows Allen to sneak in some Tea Party jokes).  Nostalgia is denial, Paul intones to Gil, who is keen to break off on his own to indulge his own reveries of the literary Paris that fuels his creative imagination.Lo and behold, that night, while wandering through a quiet part of the city, Gil is invited into an elegant old car carrying some inebriated revelers. Arriving at an even more elegant party, Gil shortly finds that hes in the company of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and that its Cole Porter playing the piano. Later, they end up at a bar with Ernest Hemingway, who promises to show Gils unfinished novel to Gertrude Stein.And so begins a flight of fancy that allows Gil to circulate with, and receive a measure of approval from, his lifelong literary heroes, not to mention such other giants as Dali (a vastly amusing Adrien Brody), Picasso, Man Ray, T.S. Eliot and Luis Bunuel, to whom the young American gives the premise of The Exterminating Angel. If not more important, he also meets the beauteous Adriana (Marion Cotillard).",as beguiling as a stroll around paris on a warm spring evening something that owen wilsons character here becomes very fond of himself midnight in paris represents woody allens companion piece to his the purple rose of cairo a fanciful time machine that allows him to indulge playfully in the artistic paris of his and many other peoples dreams a sure fire source of gentle amusement to allens core audience but unlikely to connect with those with no knowledge of or feel for the paris of the fitzgeralds hemingway gertrude stein and picasso this love letter to the city of light looks to do better than average business for the writer director in the u s upon its may release and expectations in certain foreign territories could be even higher as has happened before when allen has filmed in photogenic foreign locales london in match point barcelona in vicki cristina barcelona the director seems stimulated by discovering the possibilities of a new environment in fact allen has worked in paris before as a writer and actor in whats new pussycat years ago and in one section of everyone says i love you but this is the first time hes given the city the royal treatment granted its mostly a touristic view of the city as witness the voluptuously photographed opening montage of famous sites but thats entirely acceptable given that the leading characters are well off americans on vacation playing allens alter ego this time around is owen wilson as gil a highly successful hack hollywood screenwriter still young enough to feel pangs over not having seriously tested himself as a novelist that things may not be entirely right between gil and his pushy fiance inez rachel mcadams becomes clear early on as the couple tours around with inezs friends carol nina arianda and paul michael sheen the latter an insufferable expert on all things cultural that inezs parents are right wingers also allows allen to sneak in some tea party jokes nostalgia is denial paul intones to gil who is keen to break off on his own to indulge his own reveries of the literary paris that fuels his creative imagination lo and behold that night while wandering through a quiet part of the city gil is invited into an elegant old car carrying some inebriated revelers arriving at an even more elegant party gil shortly finds that hes in the company of f scott and zelda fitzgerald and that its cole porter playing the piano later they end up at a bar with ernest hemingway who promises to show gils unfinished novel to gertrude stein and so begins a flight of fancy that allows gil to circulate with and receive a measure of approval from his lifelong literary heroes not to mention such other giants as dali a vastly amusing adrien brody picasso man ray t s eliot and luis bunuel to whom the young american gives the premise of the exterminating angel if not more important he also meets the beauteous adriana marion cotillard ,0.9985,Positive,0,"['stroll', 'paris', 'spring', 'evening', 'wilsons', 'character', 'midnight', 'paris', 'woody', 'allens', 'companion', 'piece', 'rose', 'cairo', 'time', 'machine', 'paris', 'peoples', 'fire', 'source', 'amusement', 'core', 'audience', 'knowledge', 'paris', 'fitzgeralds', 'gertrude', 'stein', 'love', 'letter', 'city', 'light', 'business', 'writer', 'director', 'u', 's', 'expectations', 'territories', 'allen', 'locales', 'match', 'point', 'barcelona', 'cristina', 'director', 'possibilities', 'environment', 'fact', 'allen', 'paris', 'writer', 'actor', 'pussycat', 'years', 'section', 'time', 'city', 'treatment', 'view', 'city', 'witness', 'opening', 'montage', 'sites', 'characters', 'americans', 'vacation', 'playing', 'allens', 'time', 'owen', 'wilson', 'gil', 'hack', 'hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'pangs', 'novelist', 'things', 'gil', 'fiance', 'inez', 'rachel', 'mcadams', 'couple', 'tours', 'inezs', 'friends', 'arianda', 'paul', 'michael', 'expert', 'things', 'inezs', 'parents', 'wingers', 'tea', 'party', 'jokes', 'nostalgia', 'paul', 'intones', 'reveries', 'paris', 'imagination', 'lo', 'night', 'part', 'city', 'gil', 'car', 'revelers', 'party', 'gil', 'company', 'scott', 'fitzgerald', 'cole', 'porter', 'piano', 'bar', 'hemingway', 'gils', 'novel', 'gertrude', 'stein', 'flight', 'fancy', 'gil', 'measure', 'approval', 'heroes', 'giants', 'dali', 'adrien', 'brody', 'picasso', 'man', 'ray', 't', 'eliot', 'luis', 'bunuel', 'american', 'premise', 'angel', 'adriana', 'marion', 'cotillard']",1,1,1,0
24,VPD_DOC4_THE_BEST_EXOTIC_MARIGOLD_HOTEL.txt,"Feel-good movie set in Rajasthan, IndiaIndia hits you like a wave. If you resist, you will be knocked down. But if you dive into it, you will be all right.These are the words of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel narrator Evelyn Greenslade, played by the luminous Judi Dench. She is one of seven British retirees who travel to Jaipur, Rajasthan, India to live in a restored luxury hotel for the elderly. Predictably, their expectations are not met  the hotel is a shambles and its future in doubt  and just as predictably, the characters who take up the challenges thrown at them find a new, unexpected life.What do you like about this country? What do you see that I dont see? asks unhappy Jean Ainslie (Penelope Wilton), who recoils in India and retreats into seething negativity. (Ive seen this reaction among people quite often in India, unfortunately; and Im sure other experienced India travellers have too.)The light, the colours, the smiles. The way the people see life as a gift, a privilege  and not a right. All life is here, answers retired high court judge Graham Dashwood, played by Tom Wilkinson.I liked the movie, but not for the expected reasons. I expected to love the portrayal of India  I did not. And I expected to like the direction, by John Madden who directed Shakespeare in Love  I did not. I thought Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) was clownish; and there are a number of cultural missteps that drove my movie buddy (whos from Delhi) mad. He wanted me to especially mention the broken landline phone  no one in India uses landline anymore  and the scene where Dev Patel and his girlfriend kiss and hug in public. This is really not done in India, especially not in traditional Rajasthan.What I liked least about the film was the sloppy script and direction. The script needs a re-write by a writer with more originality; and the pace of the film should be slowed down. It was rushed and contrived. Add another half hour, and flesh things out! The ending, especially, seemed slap-dash.What I liked most about the movie was the effect India had on some of the characters; the superb acting; the way the topic of aging is explored; and, mostly, Judi Dench. I thought Jaipur would be the star of the movie, but it is not. Judi Dench is the star. Like the other veteran actors, shes at the top of her game. Someone on Rotten Tomatoes said the talented British actors in this movie are giving a master class in doing just enough.

25,VPD_DOC5_THE_SECRET_LIFE_OF_WALTER_MITTY.txt,"Existing somewhere between the saccharine and the sublime, director-star Ben Stiller's retelling of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is an earnest, but not entirely effective fable about escaping the doldrums of daily life and seizing change. Very loosely based on the 1939 short story by James Thurber (which was previously produced for the screen in 1947 starring Danny Kaye), Stiller's adaptation depicts the title character as a nice, but forgettable man leading a humdrum, routine life.Walter's elaborate daydreams involve fantasies of himself as an action hero or a romantic explorer. But in reality he's a meek man with a life so dull that a relentlessly helpful eHarmony call center rep (voiced by Patton Oswalt) tries to help him beef up his online profile so he can get some views. Walter really just hopes to catch the attention of Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), a co-worker who is also on eHarmony.Walter's antiquated profession involves handling and cataloguing photo negatives for LIFE magazine. The digital age has finally caught up with the venerable publication (13 years into the 21st century, mind you), whose new owners (led by a bearded Adam Scott and his likewise bearded minions) are scuttling the print edition and moving the entire operation online. Layoffs are imminent.Walter is tasked with providing his new bosses with the photo that will grace LIFE's final print edition, a shot taken by legendary photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn in an extended cameo) who still shoots on film. But here's the problem: the negative of the photo in question is missing and the meek Walter, fearful for his job, decides he'll have to track down O'Connell in Greenland to get the photo or at least some answers (since O'Connell doesn't have a cell phone and is usually on the road). The ensuing journey will see Walter start to live out some of the very adventures he's so far only fantasized about.One of the film's problems is that the protagonist's secret life has no real bearing on what he truly wants to gain, which is the heart of Cheryl. She's not privy to any of his actual derring-do overseas, seeing only the changed man -- more confident and presentable-looking -- that he is when he returns. Yes, his adventures give him confidence, but so would a gym membership and a tan from a day at the beach. And the fantasies themselves, while fun and amusing to watch, are remarkably short-lived. They're basically little vignettes in the first act, but then it's all about Walter hiking (or skateboarding) through Greenland, Iceland, and later the Himalayas.The stakes are remarkably low for a story involving so much fantasy and globe-trotting. It's basically about a guy who wants to ask out the woman in the cubicle across the office and whose main task is finding a photo negative so that -- gasp! -- LIFE doesn't have to use a different image for its final cover. It's all much ado about nothing in the grand scheme of things.",existing somewhere between the saccharine and the sublime director star ben stiller s retelling of the secret life of walter mitty is an earnest but not entirely effective fable about escaping the doldrums of daily life and seizing change very loosely based on the short story by james thurber which was previously produced for the screen in starring danny kaye stiller s adaptation depicts the title character as a nice but forgettable man leading a humdrum routine life walter s elaborate daydreams involve fantasies of himself as an action hero or a romantic explorer but in reality he s a meek man with a life so dull that a relentlessly helpful eharmony call center rep voiced by patton oswalt tries to help him beef up his online profile so he can get some views walter really just hopes to catch the attention of cheryl kristen wiig a co worker who is also on eharmony walter s antiquated profession involves handling and cataloguing photo negatives for life magazine the digital age has finally caught up with the venerable publication years into the st century mind you whose new owners led by a bearded adam scott and his likewise bearded minions are scuttling the print edition and moving the entire operation online layoffs are imminent walter is tasked with providing his new bosses with the photo that will grace life s final print edition a shot taken by legendary photojournalist sean o connell sean penn in an extended cameo who still shoots on film but here s the problem the negative of the photo in question is missing and the meek walter fearful for his job decides he ll have to track down o connell in greenland to get the photo or at least some answers since o connell doesn t have a cell phone and is usually on the road the ensuing journey will see walter start to live out some of the very adventures he s so far only fantasized about one of the film s problems is that the protagonist s secret life has no real bearing on what he truly wants to gain which is the heart of cheryl she s not privy to any of his actual derring do overseas seeing only the changed man more confident and presentable looking that he is when he returns yes his adventures give him confidence but so would a gym membership and a tan from a day at the beach and the fantasies themselves while fun and amusing to watch are remarkably short lived they re basically little vignettes in the first act but then it s all about walter hiking or skateboarding through greenland iceland and later the himalayas the stakes are remarkably low for a story involving so much fantasy and globe trotting it s basically about a guy who wants to ask out the woman in the cubicle across the office and whose main task is finding a photo negative so that gasp life doesn t have to use a different image for its final cover it s all much ado about nothing in the grand scheme of things ,0.9853,Positive,1,"['saccharine', 'director', 'star', 'ben', 'stiller', 'retelling', 'life', 'walter', 'mitty', 'fable', 'doldrums', 'life', 'change', 'story', 'james', 'thurber', 'screen', 'danny', 'kaye', 'adaptation', 'title', 'character', 'man', 'humdrum', 'life', 'walter', 'daydreams', 'fantasies', 'action', 'hero', 'explorer', 'reality', 'meek', 'man', 'life', 'eharmony', 'call', 'center', 'rep', 'oswalt', 'profile', 'views', 'walter', 'attention', 'cheryl', 'kristen', 'co', 'worker', 'eharmony', 'walter', 'profession', 'photo', 'negatives', 'life', 'magazine', 'age', 'publication', 'years', 'st', 'century', 'mind', 'owners', 'adam', 'scott', 'minions', 'print', 'edition', 'operation', 'layoffs', 'walter', 'bosses', 'photo', 'life', 'print', 'edition', 'shot', 'sean', 'o', 'connell', 'sean', 'penn', 'cameo', 'film', 'problem', 'photo', 'question', 'meek', 'walter', 'job', 'o', 'connell', 'greenland', 'photo', 'answers', 'o', 'connell', 'doesn', 't', 'cell', 'phone', 'road', 'journey', 'walter', 'adventures', 'film', 'problems', 'protagonist', 'life', 'bearing', 'heart', 'cheryl', 'derring', 'man', 'adventures', 'confidence', 'gym', 'membership', 'tan', 'day', 'beach', 'fantasies', 'fun', 'vignettes', 'act', 'walter', 'greenland', 'iceland', 'himalayas', 'stakes', 'story', 'fantasy', 'globe', 'guy', 'woman', 'cubicle', 'office', 'task', 'photo', 'gasp', 'life', 'doesn', 't', 'image', 'cover', 'ado', 'scheme', 'things']",1,1,1,1
26,VPD_DOC6_THE_BUCKET_LIST.txt,"""The Bucket List"" is a movie about two old codgers who are nothing like people, both suffering from cancer that is nothing like cancer, and setting off on adventures that are nothing like possible. I urgently advise hospitals: Do not make the DVD available to your patients; there may be an outbreak of bedpans thrown at TV screens.The film opens with yet another voiceover narration by Morgan Freeman, extolling the saintly virtues of a white person who deserves our reverence. His voice takes on a sort of wonderment, as he speaks of the man's greatness; it was a note that worked in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Million Dollar Baby,"" but not here, not when he is talking of a character, played by Jack Nicholson, for whom lovability is not a strong suit.Nicholson is Edward, an enormously rich man of about 70, who has been diagnosed with cancer, given a year to live, and is sharing a room with Carter (Freeman), about the same age, same prognosis. Why does a billionaire not have a private room? Why, because Edward owns the hospital, and he has a policy that all patients must double up, so it would look bad if he didn't.This is only one among countless details the movie gets wrong.Doesn't Edward know that hospitals make lotsa profits by offering private rooms, ""concierge service,"" etc.? The fact is, Edward and Carter must be roommates to set up their Meet Cute, during which they first rub each other the wrong way and then have an orgy of male bonding. Turns out Carter has a ""bucket list"" of things he should do before he kicks the bucket. Edward embraces this idea, announces, ""Hell, all I have is money,"" and treats Carter to an around-the-world trip in his private airplane, during which they will, let's see if I have the itinerary right here, visit the Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, Hong Kong, the French Riviera and the Himalayas.Carter is faithfully married to his loving wife Virginia (Beverly Todd), who is remarkably restrained about seeing her dying husband off on this madcap folly. She doesn't take it well, but I know wives who would call for the boys with butterfly nets. Edward, after four divorces, has no restraints, plenty of regrets, and uses his generosity to mask egotism, selfishness and the imposition of his goofy whim on poor Carter. That his behavior is seen as somehow redemptive is perhaps the movie's weirdest fantasy. Meanwhile, the codgers have pseudo-profound conversations about the Meaning of It All, and Carter's superior humanity begins to soak in for the irascible Edward.The movie, directed by Rob Reiner, was written by Justin Zackham, who must be very optimistic indeed if he doesn't know that there is nothing like a serious illness to bring you to the end of sitcom cliches. I've never had chemo, as Edward and Carter must endure, but I have had cancer, and believe me, during convalescence after surgery the last item on your bucket list is climbing a Himalaya.", the bucket list is a movie about two old codgers who are nothing like people both suffering from cancer that is nothing like cancer and setting off on adventures that are nothing like possible i urgently advise hospitals do not make the dvd available to your patients there may be an outbreak of bedpans thrown at tv screens the film opens with yet another voiceover narration by morgan freeman extolling the saintly virtues of a white person who deserves our reverence his voice takes on a sort of wonderment as he speaks of the man s greatness it was a note that worked in the shawshank redemption and million dollar baby but not here not when he is talking of a character played by jack nicholson for whom lovability is not a strong suit nicholson is edward an enormously rich man of about who has been diagnosed with cancer given a year to live and is sharing a room with carter freeman about the same age same prognosis why does a billionaire not have a private room why because edward owns the hospital and he has a policy that all patients must double up so it would look bad if he didn t this is only one among countless details the movie gets wrong doesn t edward know that hospitals make lotsa profits by offering private rooms concierge service etc the fact is edward and carter must be roommates to set up their meet cute during which they first rub each other the wrong way and then have an orgy of male bonding turns out carter has a bucket list of things he should do before he kicks the bucket edward embraces this idea announces hell all i have is money and treats carter to an around the world trip in his private airplane during which they will let s see if i have the itinerary right here visit the pyramids the taj mahal hong kong the french riviera and the himalayas carter is faithfully married to his loving wife virginia beverly todd who is remarkably restrained about seeing her dying husband off on this madcap folly she doesn t take it well but i know wives who would call for the boys with butterfly nets edward after four divorces has no restraints plenty of regrets and uses his generosity to mask egotism selfishness and the imposition of his goofy whim on poor carter that his behavior is seen as somehow redemptive is perhaps the movie s weirdest fantasy meanwhile the codgers have pseudo profound conversations about the meaning of it all and carter s superior humanity begins to soak in for the irascible edward the movie directed by rob reiner was written by justin zackham who must be very optimistic indeed if he doesn t know that there is nothing like a serious illness to bring you to the end of sitcom cliches i ve never had chemo as edward and carter must endure but i have had cancer and believe me during convalescence after surgery the last item on your bucket list is climbing a himalaya ,-0.9553,Negative,1,"['bucket', 'list', 'movie', 'codgers', 'people', 'cancer', 'cancer', 'adventures', 'hospitals', 'dvd', 'patients', 'outbreak', 'bedpans', 'tv', 'screens', 'film', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'morgan', 'freeman', 'virtues', 'person', 'reverence', 'voice', 'sort', 'wonderment', 'man', 'greatness', 'note', 'shawshank', 'redemption', 'dollar', 'baby', 'character', 'jack', 'nicholson', 'lovability', 'suit', 'nicholson', 'man', 'cancer', 'year', 'room', 'carter', 'freeman', 'age', 'prognosis', 'billionaire', 'room', 'edward', 'hospital', 'policy', 'patients', 't', 'details', 'movie', 'doesn', 't', 'edward', 'hospitals', 'lotsa', 'profits', 'rooms', 'concierge', 'service', 'fact', 'edward', 'carter', 'roommates', 'meet', 'way', 'orgy', 'bonding', 'carter', 'bucket', 'list', 'things', 'bucket', 'edward', 'idea', 'money', 'carter', 'world', 'trip', 'airplane', 'pyramids', 'kong', 'riviera', 'himalayas', 'carter', 'wife', 'virginia', 'husband', 'madcap', 'folly', 'wives', 'boys', 'butterfly', 'nets', 'divorces', 'restraints', 'plenty', 'regrets', 'generosity', 'egotism', 'selfishness', 'imposition', 'goofy', 'whim', 'carter', 'behavior', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'codgers', 'pseudo', 'conversations', 'meaning', 'carter', 'humanity', 'edward', 'movie', 'rob', 'reiner', 'justin', 'zackham', 't', 'illness', 'end', 'sitcom', 'cliches', 'chemo', 'edward', 'carter', 'cancer', 'convalescence', 'surgery', 'item', 'bucket', 'list', 'himalaya']",1,1,1,1
27,VPD_DOC7_TO_ROME_WITH_LOVE.txt,"Frisky and frivolous, Woody Allens To Rome With Love serves up four comical vignettes, intercut but otherwise unrelated, in the latest stop on the directors breezy tour of romantic Euro locales. Rome makes a refreshing if somewhat superficial backdrop as various broad caricatures  half of them American, the rest Italian  contend with semi-surreal complications to their private lives in the Eternal City. This pleasantly diverting, none-too-strenuous arthouse excursion feels like a throwback to Allens short-story anthologies, with the added pleasure of seeing a game cast play along. Pic has already earned $10.2 million in Italy, where it opened April 20.While Allen has been criticized for abandoning New York to spend his sunset years traipsing around the worlds most beautiful cities, the truth is that the consistently prolific septuagenarian has been delighting a wider audience than ever with his recent visits to London (Match Point), Barcelona (Vicky Cristina Barcelona) and Paris (Midnight in Paris, Allens top-grossing pic).The standard complaint goes that Allen is now making movies for the very pseudo-intellectuals his characters have long derided, as if the multihyphenates lifelong preoccupation with death must necessarily become more profound the nearer he gets to the end. Instead, Allen seems increasingly relaxed, as if determined to meet that tall dark stranger with a chuckle, an attitude borne out by this relatively casual Roman holiday.Allen himself appears in one of the stories as Jerry, a less successful version of himself: a retired opera director anxious that he hasnt left his mark. Jerry and his wife (Judy Davis) fly to Rome to meet their future son-in-law, Michelangelo (I Am Loves Flavio Parenti). Jerry views the young man like some sort of virus their daughter (Alison Pill) contracted during her summer vacation, until he overhears Michelangelos dad (Fabio Armiliato) singing in the shower, inspiring him to sidetrack the wedding plans in favor of a self-centered scheme to stage an opera around his untrained discovery, with one hilarious hitch.In the films other Americans-abroad chapter, a successful architect (Alec Baldwin, the picture of late-life security) runs into a happily coupled architecture student who might as well be his younger self, played by Jesse Eisenberg, an actor born to star in a Woody Allen movie. When the kids naive g.f. (Greta Gerwig) invites her admittedly seductive pal (Ellen Page) to stay with them, Baldwins character hovers around, watching with knowing experience as the inevitable comes to pass. However cliched, in Allens hands, the situation yields fresh laughs, although it might have been more interesting to see free spirit Gerwig and hyper-calculated Page swap roles.The pics two remaining stories drift away from self-portraiture toward light satire as Allen recruits Italian thesps (plus Penelope Cruz) to poke fun at local stereotypes. In the first, a newlywed couple (Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandra Mastronardi) are separated on the eve of a big business meeting.

28,YF_Doc1_Hidden_Figures.txt,"“Hidden Figures” takes us back to 1961, when racial segregation and workplace sexism were widely accepted facts of life and the word “computer” referred to a person, not a machine. Though a gigantic IBM mainframe does appear in the movie — big enough to fill a room and probably less powerful than the phone in your pocket — the most important computers are three African-American women who work at NASA headquarters in Hampton, Va. Assigned to data entry jobs and denied recognition or promotion, they would go on to play crucial roles in the American space program.
Like many movies about the overcoming of racism, it offers belated acknowledgment of bravery and talent and an overdue reckoning with the sins of the past. And like most movies about real-world breakthroughs, “Hidden Figures” is content to stay within established conventions. The story may be new to most viewers, but the manner in which it’s told will be familiar to all but the youngest.
Start with the three principals, whose struggles at NASA take place as the agency is scrambling to send an astronaut into orbit. Katherine Goble is the central hidden figure, a mathematical prodigy played with perfect nerd charisma by Taraji P. Henson. Katherine is plucked from the computing room and assigned to a team that will calculate the launch coordinates and trajectory for an Atlas rocket. She receives a cold welcome — particularly from an engineer named Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) — and is not spared the indignities facing a black woman in a racially segregated, gender-stratified workplace. The only bathroom she is allowed to use is in a distant building, and she horrifies her new co-workers when she helps herself to a cup of coffee.
Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) and Mary (Janelle Monáe) also face discrimination. Dorothy, who is in charge of several dozen computers, is repeatedly denied promotion to supervisor and treated with condescension by her immediate boss (Kirsten Dunst). The Polish-born engineer (Olek Krupa) with whom Mary works is more enlightened, but Mary runs into the brick wall of Virginia’s Jim Crow laws when she tries to take graduate-level physics courses.
“Hidden Figures” effectively conveys the poisonous normalcy of white supremacy, and the main characters’ determination to pursue their ambitions in spite of it and to live normal lives in its shadow. The racism they face does not depend on the viciousness or virtue of individual white people, and for the most part the white characters are not treated as heroes for deciding, at long last, to behave decently. Two of them, however, are singled out for commendation: John Glenn, portrayed by Glen Powell as a natural democrat with no time for racial hierarchies; and Al Harrison, the head of Katherine’s group, for whom the success of the mission is more important than color.
“Hidden Figures” makes a fascinating and timely companion to “Loving,” Jeff Nichols’s film about the Virginia couple who challenged their state’s law against interracial marriage, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1967. The two movies take place in the same state in the same era, and focus on the quiet dramas that move history forward. They introduce you to real people you might wish you had known more about earlier. They can fill you with outrage at the persistence of injustice and gratitude toward those who had the grit to stand up against it.

29,YF_Doc2_The_Imitation_Game.txt,"“The Imitation Game” is a highly conventional movie about a profoundly unusual man. This is not entirely a bad thing. Alan Turing’s tragically shortened life — he was 41 when he died in 1954 — is a complex and fascinating story, bristling with ideas and present-day implications, and it benefits from the streamlined structure and accessible presentation of modern prestige cinema. The science is not too difficult, the emotions are clear and emphatic, and the truth of history is respected just enough to make room for tidy and engrossing drama.
An Alan Turing biopic is, all in all, a very welcome thing. His decisive contribution to the breaking of the Nazi Enigma code gave the Allied forces an intelligence advantage that helped defeat Germany, though the extent of his wartime role was kept secret for many years. The secret of his homosexuality was revealed when he was arrested on indecency charges in 1952, caught up in a Cold War climate of homophobia and political paranoia and subjected to the pseudoscientific cruelty of the British judicial system.
His Turing, whom the film seems to place somewhere on the autism spectrum, is as socially awkward as he is intellectually agile. He can perceive patterns invisible to others but also finds himself stranded in the desert of the literal. Jokes fly over his head, sarcasm does not register, and when one of his colleagues says, “We’re going to get some lunch,” Turing hears a trivial statement of fact rather than a friendly invitation.
“The Imitation Game” derives some easy amusement from the friction between this “odd duck” and the prevailing culture of his native pond. The film’s notion of Britain — not inaccurate, but also not hugely insightful — is as a land of understatement, indirection and steadfast obedience to norms of behavior that seem, to a fiercely logical mind like Turing’s, arbitrary and incomprehensible. At Bletchley Park, the country estate where teams of linguists and mathematicians are working under military supervision to break Enigma, he is seen as stubborn and arrogant. The head of Bletchley, Commander Denniston (Charles Dance), finds him insufferable, as does Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode), the suave, clever playboy who runs the Enigma project until Turing, with an off-screen assist from Winston Churchill, displaces him.
More fundamentally, “The Imitation Game” is a parable of disruption. It not only provides an origin myth for the digital age, but it also projects the ideology of the present back into the past. Turing, an eccentric visionary stuck in an organization that is bureaucratic, hierarchical and wedded to tradition, is an apostle of innovation. Commander Denniston lectures him about the importance of “order, discipline and chain of command” for the war effort, but the solving of Enigma decisively rebuts this old-fashioned notion. The strategic acumen of generals and the tactical valor of soldiers is incidental. What won the war was data, and the heroes were the tech guys (and the one woman) who worked late, snacked freely, fiddled with crossword puzzles and geeked out over a piece of hardware that looked like a giant toy. Hut 8 at Bletchley Park serves as a prototype for the corporate campuses of Apple, Google and Facebook.
Just a few years ago, this film might have felt radical and counterintuitive, like a daring, inspired leap from one era to another, or an excavation of the hidden history of the present. Instead, it has the shiny, hollow ring of conventional wisdom. It’s kind of perfect, and also kind of stale.

30,YF_Doc3_Argo.txt,"At one point in “Argo,” a smart, jittery thriller about a freakish and little-known chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis, a Hollywood producer says that history starts as farce and ends up as tragedy. He seems, as someone rightly points out, to have it backward. But as a professional dissembler, he knows better. Because much like the revolutionary shock troops who seized the United States embassy on Nov. 4, 1979, and turned the crisis into gripping political theater watched by the entire world — tune in tomorrow when America goes on trial, with the special guest star the Ayatollah Khomeini — the producer knows that historical events alone don’t cut it. You need lights, camera, action.
Turning history into farce probably wasn’t what Antonio J. Mendez, a Central Intelligence Agency officer, was after when he was tapped to help free six State Department employees stranded in Tehran. While revolutionary forces were overrunning the embassy and taking hostages, including the 52 men and women who were held for 444 days, five Americans fled undetected. Eventually, they made their way to safety, including at the Canadian ambassador’s house, staying hidden (with a sixth escapee) while the C.I.A., the State Department and the president struggled to find a way to ferry them home. Mr. Mendez, a wizard of disguise, came up with the cover story for the six escapees that improbably stuck: They would pose as a Canadian movie crew.
American lives, after all, were at stake (a situation that contemporary viewers will be all too familiar with), and so, after opening the movie with a bit of history and archival imagery, he rushes into the moment’s jarring, unsettling craziness with a cinematic whoosh. Fast and faster, he sets the skittish stage with convincing you-are-there re-creations and then jumps back and forth between the chanting, exultant Iranian protesters outside the embassy and the freaked-out Americans inside it.
Mr. Affleck, working from Mr. Mendez’s book, “The Master of Disguise,” and a 2007 Wired magazine article, “The Great Escape,” by the journalist Joshuah Bearman, embellishes the official story without eviscerating it. Given how great the very premise is, it makes sense to stick more or less to the official record — a series of photographs from the hostage crisis that is juxtaposed with stills from the movie show how close Mr. Affleck hews to the evidence — and he and his production team clearly had fun with the Chia Pet facial hair, oversize glasses, wide collars, fat ties and earth-toned threads. Shrewdly, he visually transmits the escalating claustrophobia of the escapees’ confinement with billowing cigarette smoke, small rooms, a limited palette and shallow depth of field.
The Hollywood angle brings lightness and levity into the movie, serving as comic relief that Mr. Affleck uses contrapuntally with the increasingly tense, perilous situation in Tehran. The scenes of Mendez swanning through Los Angeles, across a rooftop party at the Beverly Hilton and a studio lot, where Chambers and Siegel set up shop, are enjoyably preposterous. Then again, as the Hollywood veterans knowingly observe, there is a certain kinship between the spectacle they’re putting on and the really big show the Iranian revolutionaries have staged. Budget aside, it comes down to selling the story and the roles persuasively, which the escapees — nicely played by Clea DuVall, Tate Donovan, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham and Kerry

31,YF_Doc4_Snowden.txt,"Oliver Stone’s “Snowden,” a quiet, crisply drawn portrait of the world’s most celebrated whistle-blower, belongs to a curious subgenre of movies about very recent historical events. Reversing the usual pattern, it could be described as a fictional “making of” feature about “Citizenfour,” Laura Poitras’s Oscar-winning documentary on the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden.
In the context of this director’s career, “Snowden” is both a return to form and something of a departure. Mr. Stone circles back to the grand questions of power, war and secrecy that have propelled his most ambitious work and finds a hero who fits a familiar Oliver Stone mold. Edward (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, leaning hard on a vocal imitation) is presented as a disillusioned idealist, a serious young man whose experiences lead him to doubt accepted truths and question the wisdom of authority. He has something in common with Jim Garrison in “J.F.K.” and Ron Kovic in “Born on the Fourth of July,” and also with Chris Taylor and Bud Fox, the characters played by Charlie Sheen in “Platoon” and “Wall Street.”
Like those young men in a hurry, Edward falls under the sway of two antithetical father figures, a silky apparatchik played by Rhys Ifans, and an unbuttoned renegade played by Nicolas Cage. Drawn to intelligence work out of a sincere desire to serve his country, Edward is not immune to other attractions of the job. He likes the intrigue, the money (especially after he becomes a private contractor) and the feeling of being part of a select group of insiders who know how things really work.
Nerdy in aspect and phlegmatic in manner, Edward never takes a drink or chases a skirt. (His girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, is played by Shailene Woodley.) And “Snowden” is, by Mr. Stone’s standards, a strikingly sober film. Restraint shows in both the filmmaking and the politics. There are very few wild, bravura visual flights and not much in the way of wild conspiracy mongering. Edward is a rational, ethical creature — “responsibility” is one of his favorite words — and the movie takes pains to be reasonable. 
Maybe Mr. Stone has mellowed, or maybe the world has caught up with him. What used to be paranoia — the idea, say, that your electronic appliances are spying on you — looks nowadays like blunt realism. It can also seem as if the physical world, that bloody, sex-infused battleground of the self where previous Stone heroes have raged and fought, had been displaced by a more abstract zone of codes and algorithms. Edward passes from one realm to the other when an injury ends his career as a United States Army Ranger. “There are lots of ways to serve your country,” the doctor tells him, and soon enough, his bosses at the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. are explaining that the real war is being waged on computer and cellular networks.
Mr. Stone, well served by his cinematographer, the digital wizard Anthony Dod Mantle, and the composers Craig Armstrong and Adam Peters, evokes the chilly colorations and spooky undertones of our technological reality. The Hong Kong hotel room where Edward meets with Ms. Poitras (Melissa Leo) and the journalists Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto) and Ewen MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson) is an eerie futuristic box.

32,YF_Doc5_The_Revenant.txt,"The movie is partly based on “The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge,” a 2002 historical adventure by Michael Punke inspired by the real Hugh Glass. In 1823, Glass signed on with the Rocky Mountain Fur Company for an expedition on the upper Missouri River that almost did him in when Arikara Indians attacked the group and, sometime later, he was mauled by a grizzly bear that may have been protecting her cubs. The bear should have killed Glass. Instead, its failure to do so — along with Glass’s frontier skills, some help from strangers and the indestructible romance of the American West — turned him into a mountain man legend and the inspiration for various accounts, including a book-length poem and a 1971 film, “Man in the Wilderness.”
Who exactly the savage is here is never much of an issue; as a sign scrawled in French spells out in one scene, everyone is. Mr. Iñárritu likes big themes, but he isn’t given to subtlety. There’s a shocker of an image, for instance, in “Amores Perros,” his feature debut, which expresses his talent for finding the indelible cinematic shot, the one you can’t look away from even when you want to, and also underscores his penchant for overstatement. One of those multi-stranded stories that he helped repopularize (“Babel,” etc.), “Amores Perros” includes a murder capped by the vision of human blood spilled on a hot griddle. This being a big moment as well as an illustration of Mr. Iñárritu’s sensibility, the blood doesn’t just splatter, it also sizzles. It’s filmmaking as swagger.
I thought of that artfully boiling blood while watching “The Revenant,” with its butchered animals, muddled ideas, heart-skippingly natural landscapes and moment after moment of visual and narrative sizzle. What makes too many of his moments, ghastly and grand — an arrow piercing a man’s throat, the beatific face of a beloved, a man scooping the innards out of a fallen horse, the enveloping softness of the dusk light — isn’t the moment itself, but that little something special that he adds to it, whether it’s a gurgle of blood in a throat or the perfectly lighted sheen of a hunk of offal. 
But Mr. Iñárritu blows it when he moves from the material to the mystical and tries to elevate an ugly story into a spiritual one, with repeated images of a spiral and even a flash of homespun magical realism. Worse, he makes Glass not just a helpless witness to a murder that’s a stand-in for the genocide of the Indians, but also a proxy victim of that catastrophe. It’s disappointing in a movie that offers much and that actually points to another foundation story that emerges when one of Glass’s companions, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), tries and fails to get paid for his labor.

33,YF_Doc6_Lincoln.txt,"After a brutal, kinetic beginning — a scene of muddy, hand-to-hand combat that evokes the opening of “Saving Private Ryan”— “Lincoln” settles down into what looks like the familiar pageantry and speechifying of costume drama. A flock of first-rate character actors parades by in the heavy woolen plumage of the past. The smaller, plainer America of the mid-19th century is evoked by the brownish chiaroscuro of Janusz Kaminski’s cinematography, by the mud, brick and wood of Rick Carter’s production design and by enough important facial hair to make the young beard farmers of 21st-century Brooklyn weep tears of envy.
The main business of “Lincoln” is framed by two of those, the Gettysburg Address — quoted back to the president by awed Union soldiers on a January night in 1865 — and his Second Inaugural Address, which he delivered a little more than a month before the end of the Civil War and his own assassination. These are big, famous words and momentous events, and the task Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Kushner have set themselves is to make this well-known story fresh and surprising. Mr. Day-Lewis, for his part, must convey both the human particularity and the greatness of a man who is among the most familiar and the most enigmatic of American leaders. We carry him around in our pockets every day, and yet we still argue and wonder about who he was.
The legal and ideological questions surrounding what would become (spoiler alert for those who slept through high school history) the 13th Amendment to the Constitution are crisply and cogently illustrated. Once Lincoln has decided that ratification is both the right and necessary thing to do, he has to hold his party together and also pick up a handful of votes from lame-duck Democratic congressmen.
The question facing Lincoln is stark: Should he abolish slavery, once and for all, even if it means prolonging the war? The full weight and scale of this dilemma are the central lesson “Lincoln” asks us to grasp. The film places slavery at the center of the story, emphatically countering the revisionist tendency to see some other, more abstract thing — states’ rights, Southern culture, industrial capitalism — as the real cause of the Civil War. Though most of the characters are white (two notable and vital exceptions are Stephen Henderson and Gloria Reuben, as the Lincolns’ household servants), this is finally a movie about how difficult and costly it has been for the United States to recognize the full and equal humanity of black people.
There is no end to this story, which may be why Mr. Spielberg’s much-noted fondness for multiple denouements is in evidence here. There are at least five moments at which the narrative and the themes seem to have arrived at a place of rest. (The most moving for me is a quiet scene when the 13th Amendment is read aloud. I won’t give away by whom.) But the movie keeps going, building a symphony of tragedy and hope that celebrates Lincoln’s great triumph while acknowledging the terror, disappointment and other complications to come.

34,YF_Doc7_The_Fifth_Estate.txt,"Mr. Assange, who has published hundreds of thousands of classified documents exposing the secrets of governments, banks and other powerful institutions, is a figure who inspires strong feelings, including ambivalence. The intense devotion of some of his admirers can seem like yet another digital cult of personality, while the disdain and condescension of critics often looks defensive and clueless. “The Fifth Estate” tries to have it both ways, to harness the righteous, transgressive thrill of the WikiLeaks project and also to wag a cautionary finger when it appears to go too far.
The story, flashing back from a pivotal moment in 2010 when Assange and his colleagues are preparing to publish a huge cache of diplomatic cables, traces an arc from admiration to disillusionment. It charts the relationship between Assange and Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Brühl), a German hacker who joined WikiLeaks in 2007 and later wrote one of the books that Mr. Condon and Mr. Singer drew upon. Daniel is initially impressed by Assange’s courage and idealism and dazzled by his charisma. Leapfrogging from city to city, sleeping on couches and living out of a backpack, Assange is like a cyber-anarchist Joan of Arc, a clean-shaven, silver-haired wizard in the kingdom of the scruffy.
He is suspicious of authority, committed to truth-telling and instinctively drawn to the side of the underdog. He also shows tendencies toward paranoia, monomania and rudeness. He hogs laptops and power cords, bursts in on Daniel and his girlfriend (Alicia Vikander) as they are trying to enjoy a quiet moment and brings in new recruits who threaten Daniel’s special position. He also, almost incidentally, has a transformative effect on the practice of journalism, entering into mutually beneficial if sometimes awkward alliances with publications like Der Spiegel, The Guardian and The New York Times.
When WikiLeaks exposes the shady dealings of an international bank and publishes video of the killing of civilians in Afghanistan, “The Fifth Estate” becomes a swift and rousing global thriller, with energy and velocity that recall some of the better “Bourne” movies and a flurry of fine supporting performances. (The always excellent David Thewlis deserves mention for his brooding, fidgety portrayal of the Guardian reporter Nick Davies.) But the geopolitics and the news-breaking are tangled up in too much psychodrama, and the movie loses its focus and energy as subplots and tangential themes proliferate. As we zoom from squatter apartments to newsrooms to government offices (where Laura Linney, Stanley Tucci and Anthony Mackie worry about their jobs and their diplomatic contacts), the picture grows fuzzier, and the vital questions it wants to raise about privacy, transparency and security grow muddier.
I blame the Internet. Like nearly every other movie that tries to confront that elusive, pervasive force head on, this one quickly loses track of what it is talking about. The challenge of conveying, on screen, the special intensity of online life is formidable. The clicking of keys and the dragging of mice; the pallor of faces illuminated by glowing plasma; the little bar, always growing too slowly, that shows how much data has been downloaded — these are visual clichés that seem to be the only available tools.

35,SD_12 years a slave.docx,"7) 12 Years A slave (2013):

After ""Django Unchained"" and Lee Daniels (Links to an external site.)' ""The Butler,"" both informed by the shameful legacy of slavery and institutionalized injustice in America, you might think you have satisfied your quota of viewing incidents of racial hatred, sexual abuse and ugly brutality in the past year.

You would be wrong. While both of those box-office and critical successes offered compensation for their heavy subject matter with outbreaks of humor and a hip attitude, ""12 Years a Slave"" is a somber, meditative, almost poetic film that delivers the horrors of bondage stripped down and head-on.

For once, history is presented as personal and immediate, not a saga relying on scholarly works and court records à la ""Amistad (Links to an external site.)."" The source is a rare first-hand account based on the best-selling 19th-century memoir written by Solomon Northup, a free black man from upstate New York who suddenly had his liberty torn away after being kidnapped and sold for slave labor in Louisiana.

While ""Django"" and ""The Butler"" were slaps in the face of inequality, this is a punch to the gut. Don't let those pastoral passages of Southern skies framed by gnarled tree limbs adorned in lacy Spanish moss fool you: they seem to exist merely as a placeholder, so that viewers can catch their breath from what they've just witnessed. Even Mel Gibson (Links to an external site.), whose unbearable 5-minute whipping scene in ""The Passion of the Christ (Links to an external site.)"" set the standard for such graphic cinematic punishment, would be aghast if not envious of how British director Steve McQueen (Links to an external site.) ensures that the audience palpably feels the flesh-ripping agony of every lashing and beating on screen.

Underscoring the cruelty—so commonplace that, in one disturbing scene, workers go about their daily routine as our hero struggles for hours dangling on his tippy-toes while trying not to succumb to the noose around his neck—is the aptly unsettling and sometimes discordant soundtrack by Hans Zimmer (Links to an external site.), reminiscent of his own strong work on ""Inception (Links to an external site.)"" but to much different effect.

As in ""Precious,"" where the miraculous Gabourey Sidibe (Links to an external site.) kept us watching what we didn't want to see, so, too, the solemnly powerful Chiwetel Eijofor provides us with a reason for not averting our eyes. The British stage veteran born to Nigerian parents first caught the public's attention in 2002's ""Dirty Pretty Things (Links to an external site.)"" and has been quietly simmering in primarily supporting roles until now. One can't imagine ""12 Years a Slave"" without him in the lead. His expressions as his character is forced to sublimate his very nature in order to survive say more than whole script's worth of dialogue.

With three features under his belt, McQueen has established his auteurship as a unflinching tackler of difficult subjects with a humanistic edge: discomfort cinema, if you will.

36,SD_Birdman.docx,"6) Birdman (or the unexpected virtue of ignorance):

The first time we see Michael Keaton (Links to an external site.) in his tighty-whities in “Birdman,” it’s from behind. His character, a formerly high-flying movie star, is sitting in the lotus position in his dressing room of a historic Broadway theatre, only he’s levitating above the ground. Bathed in sunlight streaming in from an open window, he looks peaceful. But a voice inside his head is growling, grumbling, gnawing at him grotesquely about matters both large and small.

The next time we see Keaton in his tighty-whities in “Birdman,” he’s dashing frantically through Times Square at night, having accidentally locked himself out of that same theatre in the middle of a performance of a Raymond Carver (Links to an external site.) production that he stars in, wrote and directed. He’s swimming upstream through a river of gawking tourists, autograph seekers, food carts and street performers. But despite the chaos that surrounds him, he seems purposeful, driven and–for the first time–oddly content.

These are the extremes that director Alejandro G. Inarritu navigates with audacious ambition and spectacular skill in “Birdman”–the full title of which is “Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance).” He’s made a film that’s both technically astounding yet emotionally rich, intimate yet enormous, biting yet warm, satirical yet sweet. It’s also the first time that Inarritu, the director of ponderous downers like “Babel (Links to an external site.)” and “Biutiful (Links to an external site.),” actually seems to be having some fun.

Make that a ton of fun. “Birdman” is a complete blast from start to finish. The gimmick here–and it’s a doozy, and it works beautifully–is that Inarritu has created the sensation that you are watching a two-hour film shot all in one take. Working with the brilliant and inventive cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Links to an external site.) (who won an Oscar this year for shooting “Gravity (Links to an external site.)” for Inarritu’s close friend and fellow Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron (Links to an external site.)), Inarritu has constructed the most delicate and dazzling high-wire act. And indeed, before shooting began, the director sent his cast a photo of Philippe Petit walking a tightrope between the World Trade Center towers as inspiration.

Through impossibly long, intricately choreographed tracking shots, the camera swoops through narrow corridors, up and down tight stairways and into crowded streets. It comes in close for quiet conversations and soars between skyscrapers for magical-realism flights of fancy.

37,SD_Green Book.docx,"2) Green Book (2018):

It’s pure formula, of course. Two men—one white, one black—from polar opposite backgrounds with wildly contrasting personalities get thrown together under unusual circumstances. They learn from each other, change each other for the better and discover that—guess what?—they’re not so different after all.

“Green Book” is all that and more: It also takes place while the two men are driving across the American South during 1962, so it contains multiple formulas at once. It’s the mismatched-buddy road trip movie with a message about race relations, arriving in theaters at the height of awards season and the holidays, just in time to make us all feel better about the world—or at least give us a brief glimmer of hope during this period of political and ideological division. As an added bonus, it also happens to have been inspired by a true story.

But damned if it doesn’t work beautifully for nearly the entirety of its two hour-plus running time. “Green Book” is the kind of old-fashioned filmmaking big studios just don’t offer anymore. It’s glossy and zippy, gliding along the surface of deeply emotional, complex issues while dipping down into them just enough to give us a taste of some actual substance.

And its enjoyability comes almost completely from its starring performances from an excellent Viggo Mortensen (Links to an external site.) and Mahershala Ali (Links to an external site.). Both actors imbue their roles with precision and pathos. They find nuance within their familiar types individually and share a spirited chemistry with each other. They are a joy to watch together from start to finish, even though you can tell from the beginning exactly how specific moments between them are going to play out by the end.

You may be surprised to learn that this conventional piece of classy, inspirational filmmaking comes from director and co-writer Peter Farrelly (Links to an external site.), a longtime standard bearer of lowbrow comedy alongside his brother, Bobby. It’s a rare opportunity for him to direct solo, and it may seem like a departure. But the Farrellys’ woefully underappreciated bowling comedy “Kingpin (Links to an external site.)” features quite a few of the same sorts of opposites-on-a-road-trip themes, as well as the possibility for unexpected friendship. An underlying sweetness—and the need to be decent to others—quite frequently exists beneath the gross-out gags and bodily fluids that have been the brothers’ bread and butter for decades. And that’s certainly at the heart of “Green Book.”

In a racial flip of “Driving Miss Daisy (Links to an external site.),” nearly 30 years after that film won a handful of Oscars including best picture, “Green Book” features a white man serving as a chauffeur—and valet, and muscle, and all-around problem solver—to a black man. (That’s not to say the film is entirely free of icky white savior moments, but it does offer instances of Ali’s character rescuing Mortensen’s, as well.) The title comes from the travel guide of restaurants and motels blacks were allowed to frequent in the segregated South.", green book it s pure formula of course two men one white one black from polar opposite backgrounds with wildly contrasting personalities get thrown together under unusual circumstances they learn from each other change each other for the better and discover that guess what they re not so different after all green book is all that and more it also takes place while the two men are driving across the american south during so it contains multiple formulas at once it s the mismatched buddy road trip movie with a message about race relations arriving in theaters at the height of awards season and the holidays just in time to make us all feel better about the world or at least give us a brief glimmer of hope during this period of political and ideological division as an added bonus it also happens to have been inspired by a true story but damned if it doesn t work beautifully for nearly the entirety of its two hour plus running time green book is the kind of old fashioned filmmaking big studios just don t offer anymore it s glossy and zippy gliding along the surface of deeply emotional complex issues while dipping down into them just enough to give us a taste of some actual substance and its enjoyability comes almost completely from its starring performances from an excellent viggo mortensen links to an external site and mahershala ali links to an external site both actors imbue their roles with precision and pathos they find nuance within their familiar types individually and share a spirited chemistry with each other they are a joy to watch together from start to finish even though you can tell from the beginning exactly how specific moments between them are going to play out by the end you may be surprised to learn that this conventional piece of classy inspirational filmmaking comes from director and co writer peter farrelly links to an external site a longtime standard bearer of lowbrow comedy alongside his brother bobby it s a rare opportunity for him to direct solo and it may seem like a departure but the farrellys woefully underappreciated bowling comedy kingpin links to an external site features quite a few of the same sorts of opposites on a road trip themes as well as the possibility for unexpected friendship an underlying sweetness and the need to be decent to others quite frequently exists beneath the gross out gags and bodily fluids that have been the brothers bread and butter for decades and that s certainly at the heart of green book in a racial flip of driving miss daisy links to an external site nearly years after that film won a handful of oscars including best picture green book features a white man serving as a chauffeur and valet and muscle and all around problem solver to a black man that s not to say the film is entirely free of icky white savior moments but it does offer instances of ali s character rescuing mortensen s as well the title comes from the travel guide of restaurants and motels blacks were allowed to frequent in the segregated south ,0.9977,Positive,0,"['book', 'formula', 'course', 'men', 'black', 'backgrounds', 'personalities', 'circumstances', 'change', 'book', 'place', 'men', 'south', 'formulas', 'buddy', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'message', 'race', 'relations', 'theaters', 'height', 'awards', 'season', 'holidays', 'time', 'world', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'period', 'division', 'bonus', 'story', 't', 'entirety', 'hour', 'time', 'book', 'kind', 'studios', 'don', 't', 'offer', 'gliding', 'surface', 'issues', 'taste', 'substance', 'enjoyability', 'performances', 'viggo', 'links', 'site', 'mahershala', 'ali', 'links', 'site', 'actors', 'roles', 'precision', 'pathos', 'nuance', 'types', 'chemistry', 'joy', 'start', 'beginning', 'moments', 'end', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'director', 'writer', 'peter', 'site', 'bearer', 'comedy', 'brother', 'opportunity', 'departure', 'farrellys', 'bowling', 'comedy', 'kingpin', 'links', 'site', 'sorts', 'opposites', 'road', 'trip', 'themes', 'possibility', 'friendship', 'sweetness', 'need', 'others', 'gags', 'fluids', 'brothers', 'bread', 'butter', 'decades', 'heart', 'book', 'flip', 'daisy', 'links', 'site', 'years', 'film', 'handful', 'oscars', 'picture', 'book', 'man', 'chauffeur', 'valet', 'muscle', 'problem', 'man', 'film', 'savior', 'moments', 'instances', 'ali', 'character', 'rescuing', 'mortensen', 'title', 'travel', 'guide', 'restaurants', 'motels', 'blacks', 'south']",1,1,1,0
38,SD_Moonlight.docx,"4) Moonlight (2016):

“Who is you, man?” Dramatic film has long been fascinated with issues of identity, but they’ve rarely been explored with the degree of eloquence and heartbreaking beauty as in Barry Jenkins (Links to an external site.)’ masterful “Moonlight,” one of the essential American films of 2016. “Moonlight” is a film that is both lyrical and deeply grounded in its character work, a balancing act that’s breathtaking to behold. It is one of those rare pieces of filmmaking that stays completely focused on its characters while also feeling like it’s dealing with universal themes about identity, sexuality, family, and, most of all, masculinity. And yet it's never preachy or moralizing. It is a movie in which deep, complex themes are reflected through character first and foremost. Jenkins’ film is confident in every single aspect of the way that a critic can use that word. Every performance, every shot choice, every piece of music, every lived-in setting—it’s one of those rare movies that just doesn’t take a wrong step, and climaxes in a scene not of CGI or twists but of dialogue that is one of the best single scenes in years.

The protagonist of “Moonlight” reflects the conflicted and fluid masculinity of young African-American men in the United States, even in just the way he’s presented. The film is divided into three chapters—“Little,” “Chiron” and “Black”—the three names used to refer to the same person that we follow from childhood through adolescence to adulthood. He’s a boy and then a man who has trouble figuring out his place in the world, which is also articulated by the character being played by three separate, all-remarkable actors.

The film starts with Chiron as a boy, referred to by his bullies as “Little” (Alex R. Hibbert (Links to an external site.)). We meet this youngster running, trying to hide in a boarded up apartment from the kids who want to beat him up. Little is found there by Juan (Mahershala Ali (Links to an external site.), doing career-best work), a local drug dealer. Juan takes the kid out to eat, even bringing him back to his place, where he meets his partner Teresa (Janelle Monáe (Links to an external site.)). Little could use this makeshift family. His dad is gone and his mother Paula (Naomie Harris (Links to an external site.)) happens to be one of Juan’s best clients. Juan becomes something of a father figure, but that might make this relationship sound more predictable than it is. Juan sees something good in Chiron and wants to help this quiet boy, even as he provides the product that’s ruining his home life.

The film jumps to Chiron as a teenager, dealing with more intense bullying and questions about sexuality. These are the years in which everyone claims to be sleeping around and a young man like Chiron (now played by Ashton Sanders (Links to an external site.)) struggles to find himself, especially now that all semblance of a normal home life is gone.", moonlight who is you man dramatic film has long been fascinated with issues of identity but they ve rarely been explored with the degree of eloquence and heartbreaking beauty as in barry jenkins links to an external site masterful moonlight one of the essential american films of moonlight is a film that is both lyrical and deeply grounded in its character work a balancing act that s breathtaking to behold it is one of those rare pieces of filmmaking that stays completely focused on its characters while also feeling like it s dealing with universal themes about identity sexuality family and most of all masculinity and yet it s never preachy or moralizing it is a movie in which deep complex themes are reflected through character first and foremost jenkins film is confident in every single aspect of the way that a critic can use that word every performance every shot choice every piece of music every lived in setting it s one of those rare movies that just doesn t take a wrong step and climaxes in a scene not of cgi or twists but of dialogue that is one of the best single scenes in years the protagonist of moonlight reflects the conflicted and fluid masculinity of young african american men in the united states even in just the way he s presented the film is divided into three chapters little chiron and black the three names used to refer to the same person that we follow from childhood through adolescence to adulthood he s a boy and then a man who has trouble figuring out his place in the world which is also articulated by the character being played by three separate all remarkable actors the film starts with chiron as a boy referred to by his bullies as little alex r hibbert links to an external site we meet this youngster running trying to hide in a boarded up apartment from the kids who want to beat him up little is found there by juan mahershala ali links to an external site doing career best work a local drug dealer juan takes the kid out to eat even bringing him back to his place where he meets his partner teresa janelle mon e links to an external site little could use this makeshift family his dad is gone and his mother paula naomie harris links to an external site happens to be one of juan s best clients juan becomes something of a father figure but that might make this relationship sound more predictable than it is juan sees something good in chiron and wants to help this quiet boy even as he provides the product that s ruining his home life the film jumps to chiron as a teenager dealing with more intense bullying and questions about sexuality these are the years in which everyone claims to be sleeping around and a young man like chiron now played by ashton sanders links to an external site struggles to find himself especially now that all semblance of a normal home life is gone ,0.9926,Positive,0,"['moonlight', 'man', 'film', 'issues', 'identity', 'degree', 'eloquence', 'beauty', 'jenkins', 'links', 'site', 'moonlight', 'films', 'moonlight', 'film', 'character', 'balancing', 'act', 'pieces', 'characters', 'themes', 'identity', 'sexuality', 'family', 'masculinity', 'movie', 'themes', 'character', 'jenkins', 'film', 'aspect', 'way', 'critic', 'word', 'performance', 'shot', 'choice', 'piece', 'music', 'movies', 'doesn', 't', 'step', 'climaxes', 'scene', 'cgi', 'twists', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'years', 'protagonist', 'moonlight', 'masculinity', 'men', 'states', 'way', 'film', 'chapters', 'chiron', 'names', 'person', 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'adulthood', 'boy', 'man', 'trouble', 'place', 'world', 'character', 'actors', 'film', 'chiron', 'boy', 'bullies', 'alex', 'r', 'hibbert', 'links', 'site', 'youngster', 'apartment', 'kids', 'juan', 'mahershala', 'ali', 'links', 'site', 'career', 'drug', 'dealer', 'juan', 'kid', 'place', 'partner', 'teresa', 'janelle', 'e', 'links', 'site', 'family', 'dad', 'mother', 'harris', 'links', 'site', 'juan', 'clients', 'juan', 'father', 'figure', 'relationship', 'juan', 'chiron', 'boy', 'product', 'home', 'life', 'film', 'teenager', 'bullying', 'questions', 'sexuality', 'years', 'man', 'chiron', 'ashton', 'sanders', 'links', 'site', 'semblance', 'home', 'life']",0,1,1,0
39,SD_Parasite.docx,"1) Parasite (2019):

It’s so clichéd at this point in the critical conversation during the hot take season of festivals to say, “You’ve never seen a movie quite like X.” Such a statement has become overused to such a degree that it’s impossible to be taken seriously, like how too many major new movies are gifted the m-word: masterpiece. So how do critics convey when a film truly is unexpectedly, brilliantly unpredictable in ways that feel revelatory? And what do we do when we see an actual “masterpiece” in this era of critics crying wolf? Especially one with so many twists and turns that the best writing about it will be long after spoiler warnings aren’t needed? I’ll do my best because Bong Joon-ho (Links to an external site.)’s “Parasite” is unquestionably one of the best films of the year. Just trust me on this one.

Bong has made several films about class (including ""Snowpiercer (Links to an external site.)"" and ""Okja (Links to an external site.)""), but “Parasite” may be his most daring examination of the structural inequity that has come to define the world. It is a tonal juggling act that first feels like a satire—a comedy of manners that bounces a group of lovable con artists off a very wealthy family of awkward eccentrics. And then Bong takes a hard right turn that asks us what we’re watching and sends us hurtling to bloodshed. Can the poor really just step into the world of the rich? The second half of “Parasite” is one of the most daring things I’ve seen in years narratively. The film constantly threatens to come apart—to take one convoluted turn too many in ways that sink the project—but Bong holds it all together, and the result is breathtaking.

Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) and his family live on the edge of poverty. They fold pizza boxes for a delivery company to make some cash, steal wi-fi from the coffee shop nearby, and leave the windows open when the neighborhood is being fumigated to deal with their own infestation. Kim Ki-woo’s life changes when a friend offers to recommend him as an English tutor for a girl he’s been working with as the friend has to go out of the country for a while. The friend is in love with the young girl and doesn’t want another tutor “slavering” over her. Why he trusts Kim Ki-woo given what we know and learn about him is a valid question.

The young man changes his name to Kevin and begins tutoring Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso), who immediately falls for him, of course. Kevin has a much deeper plan. He’s going to get his whole family into this house. He quickly convinces the mother Yeon-kyo, the excellent Jo Yeo-jeong, that the son of the house needs an art tutor, which allows Kevin’s sister “Jessica” (Park So-dam (Links to an external site.)) to enter the picture. Before long, mom and dad are in the Park house too, and it seems like everything is going perfectly for the Kim family. The Parks seem to be happy too. And then everything.", parasite it s so clich d at this point in the critical conversation during the hot take season of festivals to say you ve never seen a movie quite like x such a statement has become overused to such a degree that it s impossible to be taken seriously like how too many major new movies are gifted the m word masterpiece so how do critics convey when a film truly is unexpectedly brilliantly unpredictable in ways that feel revelatory and what do we do when we see an actual masterpiece in this era of critics crying wolf especially one with so many twists and turns that the best writing about it will be long after spoiler warnings aren t needed i ll do my best because bong joon ho links to an external site s parasite is unquestionably one of the best films of the year just trust me on this one bong has made several films about class including snowpiercer links to an external site and okja links to an external site but parasite may be his most daring examination of the structural inequity that has come to define the world it is a tonal juggling act that first feels like a satire a comedy of manners that bounces a group of lovable con artists off a very wealthy family of awkward eccentrics and then bong takes a hard right turn that asks us what we re watching and sends us hurtling to bloodshed can the poor really just step into the world of the rich the second half of parasite is one of the most daring things i ve seen in years narratively the film constantly threatens to come apart to take one convoluted turn too many in ways that sink the project but bong holds it all together and the result is breathtaking kim ki woo choi woo sik and his family live on the edge of poverty they fold pizza boxes for a delivery company to make some cash steal wi fi from the coffee shop nearby and leave the windows open when the neighborhood is being fumigated to deal with their own infestation kim ki woo s life changes when a friend offers to recommend him as an english tutor for a girl he s been working with as the friend has to go out of the country for a while the friend is in love with the young girl and doesn t want another tutor slavering over her why he trusts kim ki woo given what we know and learn about him is a valid question the young man changes his name to kevin and begins tutoring park da hye jung ziso who immediately falls for him of course kevin has a much deeper plan he s going to get his whole family into this house he quickly convinces the mother yeon kyo the excellent jo yeo jeong that the son of the house needs an art tutor which allows kevin s sister jessica park so dam links to an external site to enter the picture before long mom and dad are in the park house too and it seems like everything is going perfectly for the kim family the parks seem to be happy too and then everything ,0.9983,Positive,0,"['d', 'point', 'conversation', 'take', 'season', 'festivals', 'movie', 'statement', 'degree', 'movies', 'word', 'masterpiece', 'critics', 'film', 'ways', 'revelatory', 'masterpiece', 'era', 'critics', 'wolf', 'twists', 'writing', 'spoiler', 'warnings', 't', 'links', 'site', 'parasite', 'films', 'year', 'bong', 'films', 'class', 'snowpiercer', 'links', 'site', 'okja', 'links', 'site', 'parasite', 'examination', 'inequity', 'world', 'juggling', 'act', 'satire', 'comedy', 'manners', 'group', 'con', 'artists', 'family', 'eccentrics', 'bong', 'turn', 'bloodshed', 'world', 'half', 'parasite', 'things', 'years', 'film', 'turn', 'ways', 'project', 'bong', 'result', 'kim', 'choi', 'family', 'edge', 'poverty', 'pizza', 'boxes', 'delivery', 'company', 'cash', 'steal', 'fi', 'coffee', 'shop', 'windows', 'neighborhood', 'infestation', 'kim', 'life', 'changes', 'friend', 'tutor', 'girl', 'friend', 'country', 'while', 'friend', 'love', 'girl', 'doesn', 't', 'tutor', 'kim', 'woo', 'question', 'man', 'name', 'kevin', 'park', 'jung', 'ziso', 'course', 'kevin', 'plan', 'family', 'house', 'mother', 'yeon', 'jo', 'son', 'house', 'art', 'tutor', 'kevin', 'sister', 'jessica', 'park', 'dam', 'links', 'site', 'picture', 'mom', 'dad', 'park', 'house', 'family', 'parks']",1,1,1,0
40,SD_Shape Of Water.docx,"3) The Shape of Water (2017):

In James Whale's 1935 film ""The Bride of Frankenstein,"" the monster (Boris Karloff (Links to an external site.)) says mournfully, ""Alone: bad. Friend: good!"" That's what Guillermo del Toro's latest film ""The Shape of Water"" is all about, the loneliness of those born before their time, born different. ""The Shape of Water"" doesn't cohere into the fairy tale promised by the dreamy opening. It makes its points with a jackhammer, wielding symbols in blaring neon. The mood of swooning romanticism is silly or moving, depending on your perspective. (I found it to be both.) The film starts in a wavering green underwater world, with a woman floating in what looks like a drowned Atlantis. The image is otherworldly, magical, and Alexandre Desplat's score is wistful and bittersweet. Richard Jenkins (Links to an external site.) narrates, asking helplessly, ""If I spoke about it, what would I tell you"" about what happened to the ""princess without a voice""?

The ""princess without a voice"" turns out to be the mute Elisa (Sally Hawkins (Links to an external site.)), who mops floors in the cavernous underground tunnels of a Baltimore-based corporation (the word OCCAM—as in razor?—in towering letters over the entrance). Working alongside Elisa is Zelda (Octavia Spencer (Links to an external site.)), who provides constant running commentary through the day, responding to Elisa's sign language with a torrent of words. The year is 1962, the background is the space race and the Cold War. The head honcho at the company is a sadist racist named Strickland (Michael Shannon (Links to an external site.)), who swaggers around carrying a cattle prod (which he calls an ""Alabama howdee-do""). Whatever is done at the corporation is top secret, and everyone is paranoid about the Russians, especially once ""The Asset"" arrives in a portable tank. The Asset is the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones (Links to an external site.)), discovered in the Amazon, once worshiped as a god and now contained in a tank, enduring occasional torture via Strickland's howdee-do. The scientist Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg (Links to an external site.)) pleads for mercy on the creature's behalf. The Amphibian Man should be studied, not destroyed.

Meanwhile, Elisa is drawn to the ""monster,"" and begins a secret campaign to gain his trust. She offers him hard-boiled eggs. She plays him Benny Goodman records. She teaches him sign language. The courtship sequence is the most successful in the film, calling to mind the stunning first half of ""The Black Stallion (Links to an external site.)"" when the shipwrecked boy attempts to tame the wild horse, or the early sequences of ""E.T."" when the child and the alien start to communicate.

41,SD_Spotlight.docx,"5) Spotlight (2015):

On January 6, 2002, Boston Globe subscribers picked up their local paper and saw the front page headline: ""Church Allowed Abuse by Priest for Years."" The story, written by Michael Rezendes, a reporter on the investigative ""Spotlight"" team, was massive, in word-count and impact, but it was just the beginning. Two more Spotlight stories on the same topic ran that day, with more to follow. The uproar from the Spotlight stories (The Boston Phoenix, an alternative weekly, had covered church sexual abuse but it didn't have the circulation of the Globe) was so sustained that by December 2002, Cardinal Bernard Law, the Archbishop of Boston, stepped down in disgrace, saying in a statement, ""To all those who have suffered from my shortcomings and mistakes I both apologize and from them beg forgiveness."" (Pope John Paul II gave him a position in Rome, where Law remains to this day.) The Spotlight team won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for their reporting. These events are familiar to everyone by now, but those first Spotlight stories are painfully familiar to Boston Catholics (my family is Boston Irish-Catholic), and it was the first news story to dominate everyone's conversations since September 11th only a few months prior

Tom McCarthy's superb ""Spotlight,"" co-written by McCarthy and Josh Singer (Links to an external site.), is the story of that investigation. ""Spotlight"" is a great newspaper movie of the old-school model, calling up not only obvious comparisons with ""All the President's Men (Links to an external site.)"" and ""Zodiac (Links to an external site.),"" two movies with similar devotion to the sometimes crushingly boring gumshoe part of reportage, but also Cary Grant (Links to an external site.) and Rosalind Russell (Links to an external site.) shouting into adjacent phones in ""His Girl Friday."" At a late moment in ""Spotlight,"" there's an image of the presses printing off the edition that carries the church abuse story. Such a scene is so de rigueur in newspaper movies that it borders on cliche, but in ""Spotlight"" it is a moment of intense emotion. The truth in that edition, the evil it describes, will be a wound in the psyche of millions, but it must come out. 

The Spotlight team is editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton (Links to an external site.)), and three reporters, Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo (Links to an external site.)), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams (Links to an external site.)), and Matty Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). John Slattery (Links to an external site.) plays Globe managing deputy editor Ben Bradlee Jr.. All of the reporters are locals, and everyone has some connection to the Catholic Church (referred to as only ""The Church""). When a new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber (Links to an external site.)), comes on board, he is perceived as an outsider because he's not from Boston at all (he is first seen boning up on the city by devouring ""The Curse of the Bambino."") In an initial meeting with Robby, Baron brings up a recent piece by a Globe columnist about the Boston archdiocese's potentially shady handling of various abuse cases. Baron suggests the story could be perfect for the Spotlight team.", spotlight on january boston globe subscribers picked up their local paper and saw the front page headline church allowed abuse by
